I am Prof. Dr.-Ing. Jan-Niklas Voigt-Antons, a professor and research group leader in human-centered Extended Reality (XR: VR/AR/MR), Spatial Computing, and Digital Experience (UX/UI). I lead the Immersive Reality Lab, where we design, implement, and rigorously evaluate immersive 3D systems—ranging from real-time simulations and game-engine prototypes to spatial interfaces and interactive 3D worlds—for learning, training, and health- and safety-relevant applications.

Research areas: Extended Reality (XR), Spatial Computing, Spatial Interaction Design, Digital Experience (UX/UI), Quality of Experience (QoE), physiological and behavioral measurement, immersive learning, serious games, digital health.

My research sits at the intersection of computer science, interaction design, and human factors/engineering psychology. I study how people perceive, trust, and effectively use interactive systems, combining Quality of Experience (QoE) methods with behavioral and physiological measurement to produce evidence-based design guidance. Current work includes socially acceptable XR interaction, immersive learning and serious games, AI-supported interaction, and human-in-the-loop evaluation in simulator-like environments.

In teaching, I cover both foundations and advanced practice: technical and mathematical XR basics, computer graphics and real-time rendering, game development with modern engines, and UX for complex spatial interfaces—delivered in project-based formats with strong transfer orientation. I actively collaborate with academia, industry, and public-sector partners, acquire and run third-party funded projects, and supervise student research from early prototypes to publication-ready results. If you are interested in collaboration, research transfer, or supervising theses and student projects, please get in touch.
