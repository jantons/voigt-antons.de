I am **Prof. Dr.-Ing. Jan-Niklas Voigt-Antons**, leading research in human-centered immersive technologies at the **Immersive Reality Lab**.

My work focuses on how people experience and interact with digital systems across **extended reality (XR)**, **quality of experience (QoE)**, and **physiological and behavioral measurement**. Current projects in our lab cover topics such as socially acceptable XR interfaces, immersive learning and training, AI-supported interaction, and digital health applications.

I collaborate across academia and industry to turn research into practical, inclusive, and evidence-based solutions. If you are interested in collaborating, supervising student projects, or discussing research transfer, feel free to get in touch.
