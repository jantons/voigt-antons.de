## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is Jan-Niklas Voigt-Antons' research focus?
Jan-Niklas Voigt-Antons researches human-centered Extended Reality (XR), including
spatial interaction design, Quality of Experience measurement, psychophysiological
sensing, and digital health applications using VR and serious games.

### What is the Immersive Reality Lab?
The Immersive Reality Lab at Hamm-Lippstadt University of Applied Sciences (HSHL)
is directed by Prof. Voigt-Antons. It investigates how immersive technologies can
be designed and evaluated to improve experience quality, task performance, and user trust.

### What is Quality of Experience (QoE)?
Quality of Experience is a research field that links technical system behavior
(e.g., network latency, resolution) to how users perceive and rate their experience.
Prof. Voigt-Antons develops QoE methods for immersive and cloud-based media systems.

### How can I collaborate with or contact Jan-Niklas Voigt-Antons?
You can reach Prof. Voigt-Antons via email at jan-niklas@voigt-antons.de or through
