## Research overview

I investigate how immersive and interactive systems can be designed and evaluated to improve experience quality, task performance, and trust. The work combines controlled experimentation, behavioral observation, and psychophysiological measurement with applied prototyping in XR contexts.

## 1) XR and Spatial Interaction

**Claim:** Natural, socially acceptable spatial interaction improves effectiveness and adoption of XR systems.

**Methods:** Interaction design, user studies, simulator experiments, mixed methods, task analytics  
**Applications:** Training, simulation, collaboration, public-space XR

**Representative outputs**
- [Towards Socially Acceptable Virtual Reality Interactions in Public Contexts](/publication/2025-06-01-C89)
- [A user study on physically active locomotion in social virtual reality](/publication/2025-01-01-J31)
- [Perceptibility and Preference of Dynamic Weight Changes in Virtual Reality Through Pseudo-Haptic and Vibrotactile Cues](/publication/2024-12-01-C83)

**Representative projects**
- [Didymos-XR](/projects/#didymos-xr)
- [ARiadne](/projects/#ariadne)

## 2) Quality of Experience (QoE)

**Claim:** QoE-driven design enables robust optimization of immersive and cloud-based media systems.

**Methods:** QoE questionnaires, factorial experiments, network impairment simulation, statistics, longitudinal logging  
**Applications:** VR cloud gaming, media delivery, digital platforms

**Representative outputs**
- [Impact of Packet Loss and Delay on Presence and User Experience in VR Cloud Gaming](/publication/2024-10-10-C82)
- [Dynamic and Responsible Digital Twins for Extended Reality](/publication/2025-09-01-J32)
- [A quality of experience approach for cloud gaming in virtual reality](/publication/2024-07-01-J29)

**Representative projects**
- [Didymos-XR](/projects/#didymos-xr)
- [MIA-PROM](/projects/#mia-prom)

## 3) Psychophysiology and Behavioral Measurement

**Claim:** Physiological and behavioral signals provide complementary evidence for experience and workload assessment.

**Methods:** Eye tracking, physiological sensing, behavioral coding, multimodal fusion, human-subject studies  
**Applications:** Human factors evaluation, safety-critical interaction, adaptive interfaces

**Representative outputs**
- [Arousal Effects on Evaluation and Perception in Multimedia Quality](/publication/2023-05-04-J26)
- [Assessing Social Acceptability in Immersive Environments](/publication/2025-03-01-C87)
- [User-centered measurements for immersive interaction quality](/publication/2025-01-01-C84)

**Representative projects**
- [MIA-PROM](/projects/#mia-prom)
- [DigiOnTrack](/projects/#digiontrack)

## 4) Digital Health and Learning

**Claim:** XR and game-based approaches can increase engagement and effectiveness in health and educational settings.

**Methods:** Co-design, iterative prototyping, serious games, educational intervention studies  
**Applications:** Health communication, professional training, higher education

**Representative outputs**
- [The digitalization of healthcare for older adults (book editorship)](https://berlinup.books.tu-berlin.de/en/autor_innen/jan-niklas-voigt-antons/)
- [Immersive interview training and social interaction studies](/publications/)
- [Recent XR teaching-transfer publications](/publications/)
