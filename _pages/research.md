## Research overview

I investigate how immersive and interactive systems can be designed and evaluated to improve experience quality, task performance, and trust.

## What I Research (in plain language)

I study how virtual and augmented reality systems can be built so they actually work well for people — not just technically, but in terms of how natural, comfortable, and useful they feel. My lab measures user experience using questionnaires, eye tracking, and physiological sensors, and applies these findings to improve VR/AR for training, healthcare, and everyday use.
