## Teaching philosophy

I teach immersive technologies as a combination of technical implementation, human-centered design, and empirical evaluation.

## Courses taught

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Course</th>
      <th>Level</th>
      <th>Language</th>
      <th>Years</th>
      <th>Learning objective</th>
      <th>Example student outcome</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    {% for course in site.data.courses %}
    <tr>
      <td>{{ course.title }}</td>
      <td>{{ course.level }}</td>
      <td>{{ course.language }}</td>

      <td>{{ course.objective }}</td>
      <td>{{ course.outcome }}</td>

## Teaching formats

- Project-based learning with iterative prototypes
- Lab-based experiments in immersive environments
- Research-linked seminar formats with publication pathways

## Supervision

- Typical supervision volume: multiple theses and project groups per year across XR, QoE, and digital health topics.
- Example topics: social acceptability in XR, QoE under network degradation, multimodal user-state assessment, and XR-based training concepts.
