excerpt: 'This poster presents an ERP paradigm to quantify conscious and pre-conscious processing of noise in speech. Differences in early sensory and later cognitive components across masking conditions reveal that noise alters auditory processing even without explicit awareness, offering sensitive biomarkers for perceived quality.'

This poster presents an ERP paradigm to quantify conscious and pre-conscious processing of noise in speech. Differences in early sensory and later cognitive components across masking conditions reveal that noise alters auditory processing even without explicit awareness, offering sensitive biomarkers for perceived quality.
