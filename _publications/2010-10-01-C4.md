excerpt: 'We investigate whether the brain discriminates between clean and mildly degraded audio even when listeners report no noticeable difference. EEG evidence reveals pre-attentive and decision-related ERP modulations for noisy signals, suggesting subconscious processing of subtle quality impairments and implications for objective audio quality assessment.'

We investigate whether the brain discriminates between clean and mildly degraded audio even when listeners report no noticeable difference. EEG evidence reveals pre-attentive and decision-related ERP modulations for noisy signals, suggesting subconscious processing of subtle quality impairments and implications for objective audio quality assessment.
