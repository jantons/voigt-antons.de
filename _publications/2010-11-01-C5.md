excerpt: 'This work examines how signal-correlated noise affects perceived speech quality and corresponding neural responses. Combining controlled listening tests with EEG, we show that stronger degradations systematically lower subjective ratings and modulate ERP components linked to auditory processing and decision making, indicating measurable neural signatures of quality loss.'

This work examines how signal-correlated noise affects perceived speech quality and corresponding neural responses. Combining controlled listening tests with EEG, we show that stronger degradations systematically lower subjective ratings and modulate ERP components linked to auditory processing and decision making, indicating measurable neural signatures of quality loss.
