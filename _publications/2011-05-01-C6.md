excerpt: 'This poster presents an ERP study on how broadcast bit rate limitations influence word processing. Participants listened to spoken words transmitted under varying bit rate conditions while EEG responses were recorded. Distinct ERP components reflected differences in perceptual processing, indicating that neural measures can sensitively capture quality-related speech perception effects.'

This poster presents an ERP study on how broadcast bit rate limitations influence word processing. Participants listened to spoken words transmitted under varying bit rate conditions while EEG responses were recorded. Distinct ERP components reflected differences in perceptual processing, indicating that neural measures can sensitively capture quality-related speech perception effects.
