excerpt: 'This contribution explores the integration of physiological and behavioral data in multimedia quality research. By combining EEG, cardiovascular measures, and user task performance, the study demonstrates converging evidence of how quality degradations impact both perception and behavior. The approach underlines the benefits of multimodal assessment in QoE studies.'

This contribution explores the integration of physiological and behavioral data in multimedia quality research. By combining EEG, cardiovascular measures, and user task performance, the study demonstrates converging evidence of how quality degradations impact both perception and behavior. The approach underlines the benefits of multimodal assessment in QoE studies.
