excerpt: 'We explore EEG and affective self-reports while listeners perceive speech under varying reverberation. Links between acoustic degradation, perceived quality, and affective state are analyzed via spectral features and ERP components. The results motivate multimodal QoE measures that integrate perceptual and emotional responses for reverberant speech scenarios.'

We explore EEG and affective self-reports while listeners perceive speech under varying reverberation. Links between acoustic degradation, perceived quality, and affective state are analyzed via spectral features and ERP components. The results motivate multimodal QoE measures that integrate perceptual and emotional responses for reverberant speech scenarios.
