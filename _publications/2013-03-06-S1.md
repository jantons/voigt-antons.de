The contribution proposes leveraging physiological measurements to probe the temporal dynamics of subjective quality judgment. It discusses hypotheses linking attentional engagement and workload to rating behavior, suggesting multimodal experimental setups to relate physiological markers to moment-by-moment decision processes.
