excerpt: 'This paper introduces an experimental facility specifically designed to study Quality of Experience (QoE) using neurophysiological measurements. The facility integrates multimodal data acquisition including EEG, physiological sensors, and behavioral logging, enabling comprehensive analysis of user states under controlled multimedia conditions. The setup provides a standardized platform to develop objective QoE metrics complementing traditional subjective approaches.'

This paper introduces an experimental facility specifically designed to study Quality of Experience (QoE) using neurophysiological measurements. The facility integrates multimodal data acquisition including EEG, physiological sensors, and behavioral logging, enabling comprehensive analysis of user states under controlled multimedia conditions.
