excerpt: 'We discuss the role of TTS quality in auditory brain–computer interface (BCI) design for visually impaired users. Through a small-scale evaluation, differences in TTS intelligibility and naturalness are shown to impact workload, accuracy, and user preference in auditory BCI tasks. We derive recommendations for selecting and tuning TTS to improve accessibility and performance.'

We discuss the role of TTS quality in auditory brain–computer interface (BCI) design for visually impaired users. Through a small-scale evaluation, differences in TTS intelligibility and naturalness are shown to impact workload, accuracy, and user preference in auditory BCI tasks. We derive recommendations for selecting and tuning TTS to improve accessibility and performance.
