excerpt: 'We analyze blink dynamics as a non-intrusive indicator of strain during viewing of degraded videos. Reduced quality conditions increase blink frequency and alter inter-blink intervals relative to high-quality content, consistent with heightened visual fatigue. The findings motivate the inclusion of blink measures in passive QoE monitoring.'

We analyze blink dynamics as a non-intrusive indicator of strain during viewing of degraded videos. Reduced quality conditions increase blink frequency and alter inter-blink intervals relative to high-quality content, consistent with heightened visual fatigue. The findings motivate the inclusion of blink measures in passive QoE monitoring.
