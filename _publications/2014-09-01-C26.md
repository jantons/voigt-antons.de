excerpt: 'We present physiological indices sensitive to perceived speech quality under controlled degradations. Combining EEG components with peripheral measures improved discrimination between codec and noise conditions compared to subjective ratings alone. The findings advance physiological measurement as a complementary tool for speech quality evaluation and standardization.'

We present physiological indices sensitive to perceived speech quality under controlled degradations. Combining EEG components with peripheral measures improved discrimination between codec and noise conditions compared to subjective ratings alone. The findings advance physiological measurement as a complementary tool for speech quality evaluation and standardization.
