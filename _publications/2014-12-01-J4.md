excerpt: 'The quality of transmitted speech is the major indicator for telecommunication providers to classify their services. As a result, the assessment of quality is of high scientific and economic importance, and corresponding methods for assessing the quality of transmitted speech have been in the focus of multiple studies in the past. In this contribution, traditional methods are reviewed, their weaknesses are identified and improvements and extensions are proposed. The presented work covers subjective, diagnostic, instrumental, and physiological methods, as well as possibilities for evaluating long-term quality aspects.'

The quality of transmitted speech is the major indicator for telecommunication providers to classify their services. As a result, the assessment of quality is of high scientific and economic importance, and corresponding methods for assessing the quality of transmitted speech have been in the focus of multiple studies in the past. In this contribution, traditional methods are reviewed, their weaknesses are identified and improvements and extensions are proposed. The presented work covers subjective, diagnostic, instrumental, and physiological methods, as well as possibilities for evaluating long-term quality aspects.
