excerpt: 'The study examines how the order of rating scales in P.835-style listening tests (speech, background noise, overall quality) influences judgments for complex, degraded speech. Using counterbalanced scale orders, we analyze order effects, response consistency, and test–retest reliability. Findings inform recommendations for robust protocol design in speech quality assessment.'

The study examines how the order of rating scales in P.835-style listening tests (speech, background noise, overall quality) influences judgments for complex, degraded speech. Using counterbalanced scale orders, we analyze order effects, response consistency, and test–retest reliability. Findings inform recommendations for robust protocol design in speech quality assessment.
