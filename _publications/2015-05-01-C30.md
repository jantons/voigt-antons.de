excerpt: 'We adapt an attention-based behavioral paradigm to infer players’ flow states without interrupting gameplay. Performance on secondary probe tasks and response variability tracked self-reported flow across manipulated challenge levels, supporting the paradigm’s sensitivity. The approach enables continuous, minimally intrusive flow assessment suitable for laboratory and field studies.'

We adapt an attention-based behavioral paradigm to infer players’ flow states without interrupting gameplay. Performance on secondary probe tasks and response variability tracked self-reported flow across manipulated challenge levels, supporting the paradigm’s sensitivity. The approach enables continuous, minimally intrusive flow assessment suitable for laboratory and field studies.
