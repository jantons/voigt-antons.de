excerpt: 'We report EEG evidence linking self-reported flow during gameplay to changes in oscillatory activity and event-related potentials. Participants played under manipulated challenge–skill balance; spectral and ERP markers were compared across conditions. Results suggest enhanced attentional engagement and more efficient processing during high-flow episodes, supporting neurocognitive accounts of optimal experience.'

We report EEG evidence linking self-reported flow during gameplay to changes in oscillatory activity and event-related potentials. Participants played under manipulated challenge–skill balance; spectral and ERP markers were compared across conditions. Results suggest enhanced attentional engagement and more efficient processing during high-flow episodes, supporting neurocognitive accounts of optimal experience.
