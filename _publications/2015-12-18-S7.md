The document proposes a structure for a recommendation on integrating physiological measurements (e.g., EEG, EDA, heart rate) into speech quality assessment. It delineates use cases, experimental paradigms, candidate indicators, and data handling practices to complement subjective ratings with objective correlates of listener effort and affect.
