excerpt: 'We introduce a method to index flow during gameplay by combining behavioral markers with attention-related measures. Across controlled difficulty manipulations, the proposed indices tracked transitions into and out of flow states and correlated with self-reports. The approach offers a practical, temporally sensitive tool for evaluating game experiences.'

We introduce a method to index flow during gameplay by combining behavioral markers with attention-related measures. Across controlled difficulty manipulations, the proposed indices tracked transitions into and out of flow states and correlated with self-reports. The approach offers a practical, temporally sensitive tool for evaluating game experiences.
