excerpt: 'We analyze EEG recordings from gameplay to explore directed functional connectivity between orienting and executive attentional networks during self-reported flow. Using Granger causality, we compare connectivity patterns across low-, medium-, and high-engagement conditions. Findings support a reconfiguration toward more efficient information transfer under flow, offering neural evidence for attentional tuning in optimal experience.'

We analyze EEG recordings from gameplay to explore directed functional connectivity between orienting and executive attentional networks during self-reported flow. Using Granger causality, we compare connectivity patterns across low-, medium-, and high-engagement conditions. Findings support a reconfiguration toward more efficient information transfer under flow, offering neural evidence for attentional tuning in optimal experience.
