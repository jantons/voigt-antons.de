We present the protocol of a cluster-randomized controlled trial evaluating a tablet-based psychosocial intervention for nursing home residents with dementia. Primary outcomes target quality of life and behavioral symptoms; secondary outcomes include staff burden and feasibility metrics. The study addresses implementation at ward level and explores moderators of intervention effectiveness.
