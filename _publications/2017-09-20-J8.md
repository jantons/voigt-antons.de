excerpt: 'Quality of transmitted speech can be decomposed into three perceptual dimensions: Noisiness, coloration and discontinuity (Wältermann, Dimension-based quality modeling of transmitted speech. Springer, Berlin. doi:10.1007/978-3-642-35019-1 Add to Citavi project by DOI, 2013). The purpose of the present study was to explore whether degradation of speech quality on each perceptual dimension affected the morphological and temporal characteristics of the P300 event-related brain potential (ERP) component. The P300 is composed of two subcomponents, P3a and P3b, which served as neurophysiological indicators of distinct processes in human quality perception (Polich, Neuropsychology of P300.

Springer International Publishing, Cham, pp. 11–33, 2014): While the earlier P3a reflects attentional processing after the occurrence of novel sensory events, the later P3b is associated with memory operations following the detection of task-relevant stimuli. Electroencephalography (EEG) was used to record the electrical brain activity of subjects (N=24) performing a three-stimulus oddball task. Degraded stimuli were generated from the audio recording of a spoken word. The analysis of P3a- and P3b-related activity at electrode positions Fz, Cz and Pz provided support for the existence of different perceptual references for quality-impaired vs. high-quality stimulus contexts as well as quality degradations on single perceptual dimensions.'
