excerpt: 'We compare traditional clinical tests of cognitive and motor function with task-derived performance indicators captured by mHealth applications. Correlation analyses suggest app-based metrics can approximate selected constructs while offering higher sampling frequency and ecological validity. The work outlines opportunities and limitations for integrating app telemetry into routine assessment.'

We compare traditional clinical tests of cognitive and motor function with task-derived performance indicators captured by mHealth applications. Correlation analyses suggest app-based metrics can approximate selected constructs while offering higher sampling frequency and ecological validity. The work outlines opportunities and limitations for integrating app telemetry into routine assessment.
