excerpt: 'We report qualitative findings on the feasibility of a tablet-assisted care concept for community-dwelling people with dementia. Interviews and focus groups with patients, caregivers, and providers highlight perceived benefits (structured planning, improved communication) and barriers (training needs, data protection, workload). The insights inform design requirements and a subsequent controlled evaluation.'

We report qualitative findings on the feasibility of a tablet-assisted care concept for community-dwelling people with dementia. Interviews and focus groups with patients, caregivers, and providers highlight perceived benefits (structured planning, improved communication) and barriers (training needs, data protection, workload). The insights inform design requirements and a subsequent controlled evaluation.
