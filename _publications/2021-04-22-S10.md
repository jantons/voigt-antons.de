This proposal initiates a new ITU-T work item to standardize subjective evaluation methods for interactive virtual reality (VR) applications. It outlines the motivation, scope, and core Quality of Experience (QoE) dimensions, and sketches a modular framework covering task design, participant management, instrumentation, and reporting to ensure reproducible and comparable VR studies.
