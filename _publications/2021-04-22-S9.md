excerpt: 'The contribution refines the treatment of human influencing factors in Rec. G.1035 by distinguishing static (e.g., demographics, abilities) from dynamic (e.g., fatigue, affect, adaptation) user characteristics. It proposes measurement and reporting guidance to better capture these factors’ impact on perceived quality and performance in contemporary interactive media scenarios.'

The contribution refines the treatment of human influencing factors in Rec. G.1035 by distinguishing static (e.g., demographics, abilities) from dynamic (e.g., fatigue, affect, adaptation) user characteristics. It proposes measurement and reporting guidance to better capture these factors’ impact on perceived quality and performance in contemporary interactive media scenarios.
