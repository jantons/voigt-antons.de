excerpt: 'The contribution surveys metaverse use cases—collaborative work, live events, education, and cultural heritage—and maps them to existing and emerging MPEG tools (immersive media, point clouds, neural compression, metadata). Gaps are identified in interoperability, identity, and QoE signalling, motivating standardization directions and cross-WG coordination.'

The contribution surveys metaverse use cases—collaborative work, live events, education, and cultural heritage—and maps them to existing and emerging MPEG tools (immersive media, point clouds, neural compression, metadata). Gaps are identified in interoperability, identity, and QoE signalling, motivating standardization directions and cross-WG coordination.
