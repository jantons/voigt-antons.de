excerpt: 'We present a modular backend architecture for predictive maintenance that streamlines data ingestion, labeling, and model deployment while supporting human-in-the-loop workflows. The system integrates scalable storage, message queues, and inference services with UI components for anomaly review. Benchmarks from an industrial pilot show reduced latency, improved data quality, and faster iteration on AI models.'

We present a modular backend architecture for predictive maintenance that streamlines data ingestion, labeling, and model deployment while supporting human-in-the-loop workflows. The system integrates scalable storage, message queues, and inference services with UI components for anomaly review. Benchmarks from an industrial pilot show reduced latency, improved data quality, and faster iteration on AI models.
