excerpt: 'This study will investigate the user experience while interacting with highly photorealistic virtual job interviewer avatars in Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and on a 2D screen. Having a precise speech recognition mechanism, our virtual character performs a mock-up software engineering job interview to adequately immerse the user in a life-like scenario. To evaluate the efficiency of our system, we measure factors such as the provoked level of anxiety, social presence, self-esteem, and intrinsic motivation. This research is a work in progress with a prospective within-subject user study including approximately 40 participants. All users will engage with three job interview conditions (VR, AR, and desktop) and provide their feedback. Additionally, users&apos; bio-physical responses will be collected using a biosensor to measure the level of anxiety during the job interview.'
