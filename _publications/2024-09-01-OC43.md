excerpt: 'This contribution analyzes GPS-based mobility patterns of rural residents aged 75+ to examine how outpatient care availability relates to out-of-home activity. We quantify trip frequency, distances, and destinations and model associations with local care infrastructure. Findings suggest that accessible outpatient services can enable broader mobility and social participation, informing regional planning and age-friendly care models.'

This contribution analyzes GPS-based mobility patterns of rural residents aged 75+ to examine how outpatient care availability relates to out-of-home activity. We quantify trip frequency, distances, and destinations and model associations with local care infrastructure. Findings suggest that accessible outpatient services can enable broader mobility and social participation, informing regional planning and age-friendly care models.
