excerpt: 'The management of dementia poses challenges for patients, families, caregivers, and healthcare providers. Although digital applications can offer support, dementia-friendly options remain limited. This study highlights the importance of incorporating diverse perspectives—including those of general practitioners and family caregivers—into the development of supportive healthcare applications. Using a qualitative approach with interviews and an expert workshop, the research applied Kuckartz’s content analysis method supported by MAXQDA. The findings emphasize the need for multidisciplinary collaboration and iterative, feedback-driven design to create effective digital tools for dementia care.'
