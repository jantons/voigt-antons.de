excerpt: "We investigate how AR-based table arrangement and dynamic lighting control shape dining-related user experience in a simulated restaurant. In a controlled study, participants customized table setups and ambient light, then rated aesthetics, comfort, and decision confidence. Personalizable AR overlays improved perceived atmosphere and engagement, informing design guidelines for hospitality and retail XR applications."
