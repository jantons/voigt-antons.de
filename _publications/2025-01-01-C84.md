excerpt: "This work proposes a user-centric evaluation toolkit for XR digital twin applications that combines task analytics, heuristic inspection, presence and UX scales, workload measures, and think-aloud protocols. We demonstrate the approach on representative digital twin scenarios and derive actionable metrics and thresholds. The framework supports iterative design and benchmarking across domains such as industry, mobility, and tourism."

This work proposes a user-centric evaluation toolkit for XR digital twin applications that combines task analytics, heuristic inspection, presence and UX scales, workload measures, and think-aloud protocols. We demonstrate the approach on representative digital twin scenarios and derive actionable metrics and thresholds. The framework supports iterative design and benchmarking across domains such as industry, mobility, and tourism.
