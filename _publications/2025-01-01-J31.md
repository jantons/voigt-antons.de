excerpt: 'This virtual randomized controlled trial evaluated the effectiveness of a mobile information technology–based intervention designed to improve naming ability in individuals with post-stroke aphasia. The study examined both linguistic outcomes and user engagement, demonstrating that digital interventions can be a feasible and accessible complement to traditional speech therapy. Results highlight the potential of mobile health solutions in supporting stroke rehabilitation and language recovery.'
