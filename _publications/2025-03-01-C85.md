excerpt: "We compare pass-through video quality across contemporary mixed reality headsets during realistic everyday tasks. Using task performance, workload, and user-reported clarity, depth perception, color fidelity, and latency, we quantify how device pipelines affect perceived safety, comfort, and presence. Results highlight significant cross-device differences and provide practical guidelines for selecting and evaluating MR devices for real-world use."

We compare pass-through video quality across contemporary mixed reality headsets during realistic everyday tasks. Using task performance, workload, and user-reported clarity, depth perception, color fidelity, and latency, we quantify how device pipelines affect perceived safety, comfort, and presence. Results highlight significant cross-device differences and provide practical guidelines for selecting and evaluating MR devices for real-world use.
