excerpt: 'We investigate how visual attributes of avatars—such as realism, stylization, gender presentation, and attire—shape user preferences and perceived trust in health-related interactions. In a rating study with diverse participants, we compare multiple avatar designs for telehealth triage, coaching, and data collection scenarios. Results highlight design trade-offs between relatability, professionalism, and privacy, and provide guidelines for selecting avatar styles that foster comfort and adherence.'

We investigate how visual attributes of avatars—such as realism, stylization, gender presentation, and attire—shape user preferences and perceived trust in health-related interactions. In a rating study with diverse participants, we compare multiple avatar designs for telehealth triage, coaching, and data collection scenarios. Results highlight design trade-offs between relatability, professionalism, and privacy, and provide guidelines for selecting avatar styles that foster comfort and adherence.
