excerpt: 'This paper studies asymmetric collaboration patterns in VR—e.g., complementary abilities, information asymmetry, and device heterogeneity—and their impact on presence, workload, fairness, and enjoyment. Through controlled playtests, we identify design levers that balance challenge and coordination demands while minimizing frustration. The results yield actionable recommendations for crafting satisfying asymmetric co-op experiences.'

This paper studies asymmetric collaboration patterns in VR—e.g., complementary abilities, information asymmetry, and device heterogeneity—and their impact on presence, workload, fairness, and enjoyment. Through controlled playtests, we identify design levers that balance challenge and coordination demands while minimizing frustration. The results yield actionable recommendations for crafting satisfying asymmetric co-op experiences.
