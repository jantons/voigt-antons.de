excerpt: 'We evaluate a VR training program for sales conversations using a CAVE setup and avatar-mediated role-play. Compared to baseline materials, trainees show improved confidence, conversational structure, and handling of objections, with strong perceived presence and feedback usefulness. We discuss cost–benefit considerations and guidance for deploying VR sales training at scale.'

We evaluate a VR training program for sales conversations using a CAVE setup and avatar-mediated role-play. Compared to baseline materials, trainees show improved confidence, conversational structure, and handling of objections, with strong perceived presence and feedback usefulness. We discuss cost–benefit considerations and guidance for deploying VR sales training at scale.
