excerpt: 'This poster explores how e-cargo bikes can support sustainable daily mobility for families and small businesses across urban and rural settings. We synthesize findings from user interviews, ride-alongs, and route logging to identify adoption barriers (infrastructure, storage, weather, safety) and enabling service concepts. Design implications target routing, cargo management, and shared-use schemes.'

This poster explores how e-cargo bikes can support sustainable daily mobility for families and small businesses across urban and rural settings. We synthesize findings from user interviews, ride-alongs, and route logging to identify adoption barriers (infrastructure, storage, weather, safety) and enabling service concepts. Design implications target routing, cargo management, and shared-use schemes.
