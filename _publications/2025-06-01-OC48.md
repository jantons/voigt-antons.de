excerpt: 'We present a UX-driven redesign of industrial labeling tools for predictive maintenance datasets. Through contextual inquiry with domain experts, we identify pain points in annotation flow, error recovery, and metadata capture, and evaluate prototypes that reduce time-on-task and labeling errors. Results inform design patterns for scalable, operator-friendly annotation in industrial contexts.'

We present a UX-driven redesign of industrial labeling tools for predictive maintenance datasets. Through contextual inquiry with domain experts, we identify pain points in annotation flow, error recovery, and metadata capture, and evaluate prototypes that reduce time-on-task and labeling errors. Results inform design patterns for scalable, operator-friendly annotation in industrial contexts.
