excerpt: 'We compare gaze behavior and product selection strategies between physical supermarket shelves and their VR twins. Using head-mounted and desktop eye tracking (Tobii Pro 3) and integrated VR eye tracking (Meta Quest Pro), we analyze fixation patterns, dwell time, and choice latency. Results discuss ecological validity of VR shopping studies and conditions under which VR approximates in-store behavior.'

We compare gaze behavior and product selection strategies between physical supermarket shelves and their VR twins. Using head-mounted and desktop eye tracking (Tobii Pro 3) and integrated VR eye tracking (Meta Quest Pro), we analyze fixation patterns, dwell time, and choice latency. Results discuss ecological validity of VR shopping studies and conditions under which VR approximates in-store behavior.
