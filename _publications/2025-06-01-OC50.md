We present a framework for adopting VR/AR in public-sector language education, synthesizing evidence from pilot deployments and teacher workshops. The paper outlines benefits for immersion, motivation, and situated practice, alongside barriers such as device logistics, accessibility, assessment alignment, and teacher training. Practical guidelines are provided for curriculum integration and sustainable scaling.
