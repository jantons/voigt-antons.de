excerpt: 'This work surveys safety risks that arise when conducting XR user studies beyond the lab, including reduced situational awareness, bystander exposure, and environment-induced hazards. We propose a practical risk taxonomy and mitigation toolkit—covering protocol design, wearable safety, geofencing, supervision, and debriefing—and illustrate its use with pilot field deployments. The paper aims to support ethics reviews and standardize reporting of safety measures in XR research.'

This work surveys safety risks that arise when conducting XR user studies beyond the lab, including reduced situational awareness, bystander exposure, and environment-induced hazards. We propose a practical risk taxonomy and mitigation toolkit—covering protocol design, wearable safety, geofencing, supervision, and debriefing—and illustrate its use with pilot field deployments. The paper aims to support ethics reviews and standardize reporting of safety measures in XR research.
