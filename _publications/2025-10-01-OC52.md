excerpt: 'We compare three assistance modalities—social robot, embodied avatar, and disembodied voice—for administering PROMIS questionnaires in clinical settings. Outcomes include completion time, missing data, user trust, workload, and perceived empathy across diverse patient groups. Findings highlight trade-offs between efficiency and engagement and inform the selection of assistance for equitable, high-quality PROM capture.'
