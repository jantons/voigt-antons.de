excerpt: 'This paper presents a modular multimodal dialog architecture designed to support the digital collection of Patient-Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs). The architecture integrates speech, touch, and visual interaction components and emphasizes extensibility, robustness, and adaptability to different user groups and clinical contexts. The work discusses design requirements, system components, and interaction flow, aiming to facilitate reliable and user-centered PROM acquisition in healthcare applications.'

This paper presents a modular multimodal dialog architecture designed to support the digital collection of Patient-Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs). The architecture integrates speech, touch, and visual interaction components and emphasizes extensibility, robustness, and adaptability to different user groups and clinical contexts. The work discusses design requirements, system components, and interaction flow, aiming to facilitate reliable and user-centered PROM acquisition in healthcare applications.
