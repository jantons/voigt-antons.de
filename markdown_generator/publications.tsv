2015-03-15	Neural Correlates of Quality Perception for Complex Speech Signals	books	Springer	This book interconnects two essential disciplines to study the perception of speech: Neuroscience and Quality of Experience, which to date have rarely been used together for the purposes of research on speech quality perception. In five key experiments, the book demonstrates the application of standard clinical methods in neurophysiology on the one hand and of methods used in fields of research concerned with speech quality perception on the other. Using this combination, the book shows that speech stimuli with different lengths and different quality impairments are accompanied by physiological reactions related to quality variations, e.g., a positive peak in an event-related potential. Furthermore, it demonstrates that – in most cases – quality impairment intensity has an impact on the intensity of physiological reactions.	Antons, J.-N.	Antons, J.-N. (2015).

2024-07-01	Außerhäusliche Mobilität von Personen ab 75 Jahren im ländlichen Raum. Ergebnisse aus einer GPS-Studie	manuscripts	Bundesgesundheitsblatt	Out-of-home mobility, defined as active and passive movement through external environments, is a resource for autonomy, quality of life, and self-realization in older age. Various factors influence out-of-home mobility, primarily studied in urban settings. The study aims to examine associated factors in a study population aged 75 and above in rural areas. Baseline data from the MOBILE trial involving 212 participants aged 75 and above and collected between June 2021 and October 2022 were analyzed. Out-of-home mobility was measured temporally as time out of home (TOH) and spatially as convex hull (CHull) using GPS over seven days. Mixed models considered outpatient care parameters as well as personal, social, and environmental factors along with covariates such as age and gender. Participants in the MOBILE study (average age 81.5; SD: 4.1; 56.1% female) exhibited average out-of-home mobility of TOH: 319.3 min (SD: 196.3). Significant associations were found for age, social network, living arrangement, health literacy, sidewalk quality , green space ratio, outpatient care utilization, and active driving. Previously known multifactorial associations related to objectively measured out-of-home mobility in old age could be confirmed in rural areas. Novel and relevant for research and practice is the significant correlation between out-of-home mobility and outpatient care utilization.	Haeger, C., Mümken, S. A., Spang, R.

2024-03-15	Situativität, Funktionalität und Vertrauen: Ergebnisse einer szenariobasierten Interviewstudie zur Erklärbarkeit von KI in der Medizin	manuscripts	Journal for Technology Assessment in Theory and Practice	A central requirement for the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine is its explainability, i. e., the provision of addressee-oriented information about its functioning. This leads to the question of how socially adequate explainability can be designed. To identify evaluation factors, we interviewed healthcare stakeholders about two scenarios: diagnostics and documentation. The scenarios vary the influence that an AI system has on decision-making through the interaction design and the amount of data processed. We present key evaluation factors for explainability at the interactional and procedural levels. Explainability must not interfere situationally in the doctor-patient conversation and question the professional role. At the same time, explainability functionally legitimizes an AI system as a second opinion and is central to building trust. A virtual embodiment of the AI system is advantageous for language-based explanations.	Marquardt, M., Graf, P., Jansen, E., Hillmann, S., & Voigt-Antons, J.-N.

2023-12-01	Effectiveness of a tablet-based intervention for people living with dementia in primary care – A Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial	manuscripts	International Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry	Primary care physicians (PCP) play a key role in the care of people living with dementia. However, the implementation and practicability of the German S3 Dementia Guideline in primary care remain unclear. The main objective of the present study was to evaluate an intervention for improving guideline-based dementia care in primary care. A two-arm, 9-month follow-up cluster-randomized controlled trial with two parallel groups. 28 primary care practices in Berlin and the surrounding area in Germany. A total of N = 28 PCP, N = 91 people living with dementia, and N = 88 informal caregivers participated in the trial. A tablet-based intervention to improve adherence to the German S3 Dementia Guideline in primary care was compared to a control group (care as usual plus a handbook on dementia). MeasurementsAdherence to dementia guideline (primary outcome) was measured on PCP’ (23 items) and informal caregivers' level (19 items) with a self-developed checklist. Secondary outcomes (quality of life, neuropsychiatric symptoms, activities of daily living, general health status, depression, and caregiver burden) were measured with standardized assessments. Also, post-hoc per-protocol analyses were conducted. No differences in guideline adherence between the intervention and the control group were observed. Further, no significant impact of the intervention on secondary outcomes was detected. The DemTab Study did not improve self-reported guideline adherence in PCP. However, important implementation barriers such as lack of interoperability and low applicability of existing German S3 Dementia Guideline in the primary care setting were identified and are being discussed.

2023-05-04	Effects of User Factors on User Experience in Virtual Reality - Age, Gender, and VR Experience as Influencing Factors for VR Exergames	manuscripts	Quality and User Experience	As virtual reality (VR) technology is extensively developing in past years, more and more people are using it in different fields. One of the fast-developing areas in VR is exergaming, a combination of physical exercise and a game. VR exergames that aim to engage people in physical activity should look and feel good for users regardless of their age, gender, or their previous VR experience with similar technologies. However, recent studies showed that those factors are influencing the user experience (UX) with virtual reality. Building on top of the initial study that has reported on the effect of human influencing factors for exergaming, with this work, we investigated the influence of user parameters (such as age, gender, and previous VR experience) on their motivation for sports and VR exergaming. The study was done using a crowdsourcing platform to recruit a diverse set of participants, with the aim to explore how different user factors are connected to sports motivation. Results show significant differences in the user’s sports motivation and affinity for technology interaction depending on the age group, gender, previous experience with VR, their weekly exercise routine, and how much money they spend on sports yearly.

2023-03-02	Smartphone Global Positioning System–Based System to Assess Mobility in Health Research: Development, Accuracy, and Usability Study	manuscripts	JMIR Rehabilitation and Assistive Technologies	As global positioning system (GPS) measurement is getting more precise and affordable, health researchers can now objectively measure mobility using GPS sensors. Available systems, however, often lack data security and means of adaptation and often rely on a permanent internet connection. To overcome these issues, we aimed to develop and test an easy-to-use, easy-to-adapt, and offline working app using smartphone sensors (GPS and accelerometry) for the quantification of mobility parameters. An Android app, a server backend, and a specialized analysis pipeline have been developed (development substudy). Parameters of mobility by the study team members were extracted from the recorded GPS data using existing and newly developed algorithms. Test measurements were performed with participants to complete accuracy and reliability tests (accuracy substudy). Usability was examined by interviewing community-dwelling older adults after 1 week of device use, followed by an iterative app design process (usability substudy). The study protocol and the software toolchain worked reliably and accurately, even under suboptimal conditions, such as narrow streets and rural areas. The developed algorithms had high accuracy (97.4% correctness, F1-score=0.975) in distinguishing dwelling periods from moving intervals. The accuracy of the stop/trip classification is fundamental to second-order analyses such as the time out of home, as they rely on a precise discrimination between the 2 classes. The usability of the app and the study protocol was piloted with older adults, which showed low barriers and easy implementation into daily routines. Based on accuracy analyses and users’ experience with the proposed system for GPS assessments, the developed algorithm showed great potential for app-based estimation of mobility in diverse health research contexts, including mobility patterns of community-dwelling older adults living in rural areas.

2023-01-05	Real-time affect detection in virtual reality: a technique based on a three-dimensional model of affect and EEG signals	manuscripts	Front. Virtual Real.	This manuscript explores the development of a technique for detecting the affective states of Virtual Reality (VR) users in real-time. The technique was tested with data from an experiment where 18 participants observed 16 videos with emotional content inside a VR home theater, while their electroencephalography (EEG) signals were recorded. Participants evaluated their affective response toward the videos in terms of a three-dimensional model of affect. Two variants of the technique were analyzed. The difference between both variants was the method used for feature selection. In the first variant, features extracted from the EEG signals were selected using Linear Mixed-Effects (LME) models. In the second variant, features were selected using Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross Validation (RFECV). Random forest was used in both variants to build the classification models. Accuracy, precision, recall and F1 scores were obtained by cross-validation. An ANOVA was conducted to compare the accuracy of the models built in each variant. The results indicate that the feature selection method does not have a significant effect on the accuracy of the classification models. Therefore, both variations (LME and RFECV) seem equally reliable for detecting affective states of VR users. The mean accuracy of the classification models was between 87% and 93%.

2021-06-29	A tablet-based intervention for activating nursing home residents with dementia: results from a cluster-randomized controlled trial	manuscripts	International psychogeriatrics	To investigate global and momentary effects of a tablet-based non-pharmacological intervention for nursing home residents living with dementia. Cluster-randomized controlled trial. Ten nursing homes in Germany were randomly allocated to the tablet-based intervention (TBI, 5 units) or conventional activity sessions (CAS, 5 units). N = 162 residents with dementia. Participants received regular TBI (n = 80) with stimulating activities developed to engage people with dementia or CAS (n = 82) for 8 weeks. Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES-I, primary outcome), Quality of Life in Alzheimer’s Disease scale, QUALIDEM scale, Neuropsychiatric Inventory, Geriatric Depression Scale, and psychotropic medication (secondary outcomes). Momentary quality of life was assessed before and after each activity session. Participants and staff were blinded until the collection of baseline data was completed. Data were analyzed with linear mixed-effects models. Levels of apathy decreased slightly in both groups (mean decrease in AES-I of .61 points, 95% CI −3.54, 2.33 for TBI and .36 points, 95% CI −3.27, 2.55 for CAS). Group difference in change of apathy was not statistically significant (β = .25; 95% CI 3.89, 4.38, p = .91). This corresponds to a standardized effect size (Cohen’s d) of .02. A reduction of psychotropic medication was found for TBI compared to CAS. Further analyses revealed a post-intervention improvement in QUALIDEM scores across both groups and short-term improvements of momentary quality of life in the CAS group. Our findings suggest that interventions involving tailored activities have a beneficial impact on global and momentary quality of life in nursing home residents with dementia. Although we found no clear advantage of TBI compared to CAS, tablet computers can support delivery of non-pharmacological interventions in nursing homes and facilitate regular assessments of fluctuating momentary states.

2021-12-18	Dementia care and the role of guideline adherence in primary care: cross-sectional findings from the DemTab study	manuscripts	BMC Geriatr	General practitioners (GPs) play a key role in the care of people with dementia (PwD). However, the role of the German Dementia Guideline in primary care remains unclear. The main objective of the present study was to examine the role of guideline-based dementia care in general practices. A cross-sectional analysis of data obtained from the DemTab study was conducted. Descriptive analyses of sociodemographic and clinical characteristics for GPs (N=28) and PwD (N=91) were conducted. Adherence to the German Dementia Guideline of GPs was measured at the level of PwD. Linear Mixed Models were used to analyze the associations between adherence to the German Dementia Guideline and GP factors at individual (age, years of experience as a GP, frequency of utilization of guideline, perceived usefulness of guideline) and structural (type of practice, total number of patients seen by a participating GP, and total number of PwD seen by a participating GP) levels as well as between adherence to the German Dementia Guideline and PwD’s quality of life. Self-reported overall adherence of GPs was on average 71% (SD=19.4, range: 25–100). Adherence to specific recommendations varied widely (from 19.2 to 95.3%) and the majority of GPs (79.1%) reported the guideline as only partially or somewhat helpful. Further, we found lower adherence to be significantly associated with higher numbers of patients (γ10=−.58, CI=−10.97, −0.19, =.04). No association between adherence to the guideline and PwD’s quality of life was found (γ10=−.86, CI=−4.18, 2.47, p=.61). The present study examined the role of adherence to the German Dementia Guideline recommendations in primary care. Overall, GPs reported high levels of adherence. However, major differences across guideline recommendations were found. Findings highlight the importance of guidelines for the provision of care. Dementia guidelines for GPs need to be better tailored and addressed. Further, structural changes such as more time for PwD may contribute to a sustainable change of dementia care in primary care.

2021-11-01	Working with environmental noise and noise-cancellation: A workload assessment with EEG and subjective measures	manuscripts	Front. Neurosci.	As working and learning environments become open and flexible, people are also potentially surrounded by ambient noise, which causes an increase in mental workload. The present study uses electroencephalogram (EEG) and subjective measures to investigate if noise-canceling technologies can fade out external distractions and free up mental resources. Therefore, participants had to solve spoken arithmetic tasks that were read out via headphones in three sound environments: a quiet environment (no noise), a noisy environment (noise), and a noisy environment but with active noise-canceling headphones (noise-canceling). Our results of brain activity partially confirm an assumed lower mental load in no noise and noise-canceling compared to noise test condition. The mean P300 activation at Cz resulted in a significant differentiation between the no noise and the other two test conditions. Subjective data indicate an improved situation for the participants when using the noise-canceling technology compared to “normal” headphones but shows no significant discrimination. The present results provide a foundation for further investigations into the relationship between noise-canceling technology and mental workload. Additionally, we give recommendations for an adaptation of the test design for future studies.	Pieper, K., Spang, R. P., Prietz, P., Möller, S., Paajanen, E., Vaalgamaa, M. & Voigt-Antons, J.-N.

2021-08-01	Emotion visualization in Virtual Reality: An integrative review.	manuscripts	Front. Virtual Real.	A cluster of research in Affective Computing suggests that it is possible to infer some characteristics of users’ affective states by analyzing their electrophysiological activity in real-time. However, it is not clear how to use the information extracted from electrophysiological signals to create visual representations of the affective states of Virtual Reality (VR) users. Visualization of users’ affective states in VR can lead to biofeedback therapies for mental health care. Understanding how to visualize affective states in VR requires an interdisciplinary approach that integrates psychology, electrophysiology, and audio-visual design. Therefore, this review aims to integrate previous studies from these fields to understand how to develop virtual environments that can automatically create visual representations of users’ affective states. The manuscript addresses this challenge in four sections: First, theories related to emotion and affect are summarized. Second, evidence suggesting that visual and sound cues tend to be associated with affective states are discussed. Third, some of the available methods for assessing affect are described. The fourth and final section contains five practical considerations for the development of virtual reality environments for affect visualization.	Pinilla, A., Garcia, J.

2021-04-01	User-specific touch interfaces: a viable solution for an aging society?	manuscripts	Behaviour & Information Technology	Touch interaction has established a dominating role in the realisation of Human–Machine Interfaces. However, to be able to use touch effectively and efficiently, users have to comply with particular prerequisites. Due to age-related changes, such as the decline of tactile accuracy and speed, especially elderly users often struggle with the touch modality. Interfaces that adapt to specific user characteristics could be a promising solution to overcome this problem. Notwithstanding the advantages of adaptive systems, perceived changes in the user interface can reduce the system's predictability and transparency. The present study compares three approaches concerning the adaptation of touch button sizes: no adaptation and adaptation with visible and invisible feedback. Results show that especially elderly users substantially benefit from an adaptive approach. Furthermore, data shows that the type of adaptation supports different usage goals. While adaption with visual feedback enables a higher interaction speed, invisible adaptation leads to a higher degree of accuracy.	Shahal, A., Spang, R., Minge, M., Trahms, C. & Voigt-Antons, J.-N.

2020-08-20	Estimation of the Quality of Experience During Video Streaming From Facial Expression and Gaze Direction	manuscripts	IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Managment	This article investigates the possibility to estimate the perceived Quality of Experience (QoE) automatically and unobtrusively by analyzing the face of the consumer of video streaming services, from which facial expression and gaze direction are extracted. If effective, this would be a valuable tool for the monitoring of personal QoE during video streaming services without asking the user to provide feedback, with great advantages for service management. Additionally, this would eliminate the bias of subjective tests and would avoid bothering the viewers with questions to collect opinions and feedback. The performed analysis relies on two different experiments: i) a crowdsourcing test, where the videos are subject to impairments caused by long initial delays and re-buffering events; ii) a laboratory test, where the videos are affected by blurring effects. The facial Action Units (AU) that represent the contractions of specific facial muscles together with the position of the eyes' pupils are extracted to identify the correlation between perceived quality and facial expressions. An SVM with a quadratic kernel and a k-NN classifier have been tested to predict the QoE from these features. These have also been combined with measured application-level parameters to improve the quality prediction. From the performed experiments, it results that the best performance is obtained with the k-NN classifier by combining all the described features and after training it with both the datasets, with a prediction accuracy as high as 93.9% outperforming the state of the art achievements.

2019-11-05	Finding critical features for predicting quality of life in tablet-based serious games for dementia	manuscripts	Quality and User Experience	While the number of dementia cases is steadily increasing, as of today no medication has been developed to cure its underlying causes. Instead, the focus in treatment has shifted to improve quality of life (QoL) for people with dementia (PwD). To this end, some non-pharmacological treatments such as exercising, socializing, and playing games have received increasing attention. PflegeTab is a tablet-based application developed for this purpose. It includes a number of services such as cognitive training games, everyday activity training games, emotional applications, and a biographical picture album. In the present paper, we explore the possibility of QoL prediction for PwD using data collected while nursing home residents played games in PflegeTab (N=81). Using features generated from the data and applying linear discriminant analysis for classification, our approach obtained an average accuracy of 74.80% on predicting QoL ratings when measured by Monte Carlo cross-validation. Furthermore, this paper investigates which features were dominant for the classification (prominent features were e.g. time needed for task completion) and briefly discusses how the results might be utilized for managing general QoL of PwD.

2019-10-30	Questionnaires embedded in virtual environments: reliability and positioning of rating scales in virtual environments	manuscripts	Quality and User Experience	Current developments in virtual reality (VR) hardware have made immersive VR experiences more affordable through commercially available head-mounted displays. As more studies are likely to be conducted using these devices, the question arises how to embed questionnaires in virtual environments without impairing the immersive user experience. In this work we investigate two different aspects: (1) if a rating performed in a virtual environment is comparable to a rating obtained via a paper questionnaire and (2) how questionnaires for assessing virtual experiences should be designed and integrated into the virtual environment. For this research, we used our own extended version of VRate—a VR questionnaire asset for Unity. In the first study with 27 participants, we compared ratings assessed within VR with ratings obtained using a paper questionnaire. We found that the ratings gathered in VR are comparable to the ratings gathered in the real world by paper–pencil questionnaires (subscales: global presence, spatial presence, and experience realism). In the second study with 48 participants, we investigated the users’ perceived suitability of the VR questionnaire and the optimal mounting position of the questionnaire (hand-mounted, head-up display or billboard). Moreover, we investigated whether the questionnaire should be answered in the same or in a separate dedicated virtual environment and how the users’ feeling of presence in VR is influenced by this placement. Results indicate a subjective preference for the billboard position, with a significant preference for billboard over hand-mounted and no significant preference between billboard and head-up-display. Regarding the placement of the VR questionnaire (in-scene vs. dedicated virtual environment) we did not find any influence on presence. In the following, we discuss the pros and cons of different placement/mounting options and provide suggestions for designing and implementing questionnaires embedded in virtual environments.

This article provides a detailed protocol of a study aimed at developing and evaluating a tablet-based intervention to improve outpatient dementia care by fostering guideline-based treatment. A cluster-randomized controlled trial with an intervention group (tablet-based intervention) and a control group (treatment as usual plus information handbook) will be conducted. Clusters will be randomized at GP level. Primary outcome is defined as adherence to dementia guideline recommendations after 9 months. Secondary outcomes include various health outcomes assessed in PwD (e.g., quality of life) and informal caregivers (e.g., caregiver burden). Outcomes will be analyzed by an intention-to-treat analysis and using mixed models.	Lech, S., O’Sullivan, J. L., Gellert, P., Voigt-Antons, J.-N. & Nordheim J.	Lech, S., O’Sullivan, J.

2019-10-14	P300 indicates context-dependent change in speech quality beyond phonological change	manuscripts	Journal of Neural Engineering	Objective. Non-invasive physiological methods like electroencephalography (EEG) are increasingly employed to assess human information processing during exposure to multimedia signals. In the quality engineering field, previous research has promoted the utility of the P300 event-related brain potential (ERP) component for indicating variation in quality perception. The present study provides a starting point to test whether the P300 and its two subcomponents, P3a and P3b, are truly reflective of changes in the perceived quality of transmitted speech signals given the presence of other, quality-unrelated changes in acoustic stimulation. Approach. High-quality and degraded variants of spoken words were presented in a two-feature oddball task, which required participants to actively respond to rarely occurring 'target' stimuli within a series of frequent 'standard' stimuli, thereby eliciting ERP waveforms. Target presentations involved either single quality changes or concurrent double changes in quality and the initial phoneme. Main results. In case additional phonological change was present, only varying quality of standard stimuli caused significant modulations in P3a and P3b characteristics (N  =  32). Thus, the formation of different short-term quality references exerted a persisting influence on the auditory processing of transmitted speech. Significance. The obtained results elucidate the importance of contextual and content-related influencing factors for proving the validity of the P300 as a psychophysiological indicator of speech quality change. Associated questions regarding the transfer of ERP-based quality assessment into more practically relevant measurement contexts are discussed.	Uhrig, S., Mittag, G., Möller, S. & Voigt-Antons, J.-N.

Apps containing more BCTs had a higher perceived effect on people’s health, and app developers should take the complexity of needs into account.

2019-03-20	Neural correlates of speech quality dimensions analyzed using electroencephalography (EEG)	manuscripts	Journal of Neural Engineering	By means of subjective psychophysical methods, quality of transmitted speech has been decomposed into three perceptual dimensions named 'discontinuity' (F), 'noisiness' (N) and 'coloration' (C). Previous studies using electroencephalography (EEG) already reported effects of perceived intensity of single quality dimensions on electrical brain activity. However, it has not been investigated so far, whether the dimensions themselves are dissociable on a neurophysiological level of analysis. Approach. Pursuing this goal in the present study, a high-quality (HQ) recording of a spoken word was degraded on each dimension at a time, resulting in three quality-impaired stimuli (F, N, C) which were on average described as being equal in perceived degradation intensity. Participants performed a three-stimulus oddball task, involving the serial presentation of different stimulus types: (1) HQ or degraded 'standard' stimuli to establish sensory/perceptual quality references. (2) Degraded 'oddball' stimuli to cause random, infrequent deviations from those references. EEG was employed to examine the neuro-electrical correlates of speech quality perception. Main results. Emphasis was placed on modulations in temporal and morphological characteristics of the P300 component of the event-related brain potential (ERP), whose subcomponents P3a and P3b are commonly linked to attentional orienting and task relevance categorization, respectively. Electrophysiological data analysis () revealed significant modulations of P300 amplitude and latency by the perceptual dimensions underlying both quality references and oddball stimuli. Significance. The present study exemplifies the utility of physiological methods like EEG for dissociating speech degradations not only based on perceived intensity level, but also their distinctive quality dimension.

2019-03-19	Mapping attention during gameplay: Assessment of behavioral and ERP markers in an auditory oddball task	manuscripts	Psychophysiology	Video games are enjoyed most when the level and speed of the game match the players' skills. An optimal balance between challenges and skills triggers the subjective experience of “flow,” a focused motivation leading to a feeling of spontaneous joy. The present research investigates the behavioral and neural correlates of a paradigm aimed to assess the players' subjective experience during gameplay. Attentional engagement changes were assessed first at the behavioral level and in a second stage by means of EEG recordings. An auditory novelty oddball paradigm was implemented as a secondary task while subjects played in three conditions: boredom, frustration, and flow. We found higher reaction times and error rates in the flow condition. In a second stage, EEG time domain analysis revealed a significantly delayed response-locked frontocentral negative deflection during flow, likely signaling the reallocation of attentional resources. Source reconstruction analyses showed that the brain regions responsible for the genesis of this negativity were located within the medial frontal cortex. Frequency domain analyses showed a significant power increase only in the alpha band for the flow condition. Our results showed that this alpha power enhancement was correlated with faster reaction times. This suggests that frontal alpha changes recorded as maximal at the midfrontal lines during flow might be related to inhibitory top-down cognitive control processes.	Núñez Castellar, E.

2018-01-11	Exploring attitudes of healthcare professionals towards ICT-based interventions for nursing home residents with dementia: a mixed-methods approach	manuscripts	Contemporary Nurse	Background: Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) could be useful for delivering non-pharmacological therapies (NPTs) for dementia in nursing home settings. Aims: To identify technology-related expectations and inhibitions of healthcare professionals associated with the intention to use ICT-based NPTs. Design: Cross-sectional multi-method survey. Methods: N = 205 healthcare professionals completed a quantitative survey on usage and attitudes towards ICTs. Additionally, N = 11 semi-structured interviews were conducted. Results: Participants were classified as intenders to use ICTs (53%), non-intenders (14%) or ambivalent (32%). A MANCOVA revealed higher perceived usefulness for intenders compared to non-intenders and ambivalent healthcare professionals (V =.28, F(12, 292)= 3.94, p <.001). Qualitative interviews revealed generally high acceptance of ICTs in the workplace. Furthermore, benefits for residents emerged as a key requirement. Conclusion: Staff trainings should stress specific benefits for residents and healthcare professionals to facilitate successful implementation and acceptance of ICTs in nursing home settings.

2017-09-20	Perceptual references for independent dimensions of speech quality as measured by electroencephalography	manuscripts	Quality and User Experience	Quality of transmitted speech can be decomposed into three perceptual dimensions: Noisiness, coloration and discontinuity (Wältermann, Dimension-based quality modeling of transmitted speech. Springer, Berlin. doi:10.1007/978-3-642-35019-1 Add to Citavi project by DOI, 2013). The purpose of the present study was to explore whether degradation of speech quality on each perceptual dimension affected the morphological and temporal characteristics of the P300 event-related brain potential (ERP) component. The P300 is composed of two subcomponents, P3a and P3b, which served as neurophysiological indicators of distinct processes in human quality perception (Polich, Neuropsychology of P300. Oxford University Press, Oxford. doi:10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195374148.013.0089 Add to Citavi project by DOI, 2012; Raake and Egger, Quality and quality of experience. Springer International Publishing, Cham, pp. 11–33, 2014): While the earlier P3a reflects attentional processing after the occurrence of novel sensory events, the later P3b is associated with memory operations following the detection of task-relevant stimuli. Electroencephalography (EEG) was used to record the electrical brain activity of subjects (N=24) performing a three-stimulus oddball task. Degraded stimuli were generated from the audio recording of a spoken word. The analysis of P3a- and P3b-related activity at electrode positions Fz, Cz and Pz provided support for the existence of different perceptual references for quality-impaired vs. high-quality stimulus contexts as well as quality degradations on single perceptual dimensions.

2016-09-08	Did You Notice It?—How Can We Predict the Subjective Detection of Video Quality Changes From Eye Movements?	manuscripts	Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing	In the case of videos, the measurement of subjective detection of quality degradation usually needs observers to report the detection. However, if this detection could be automatically deduced by nonintrusive means, viewing would not be disturbed. This study examined how the subjective detection of quality degradation can be seen from eye movements, both in terms of group averages as well as from cases of single viewing times. In the experiment, the subjects were given the task of detecting local quality degradation in a video and reporting its significance to the quality of a video. The results of group averages showed that detection of the degraded area changed the viewing strategy from a search with short fixation to an evaluation with long fixations; most importantly, once the evaluation phase had begun, fixations concentrated on a smaller area than in the search phase. The change in eye movements was due to detection and not the quality level. The change in task was also seen in the eye movement measurements from single viewings, the spatial entropy of fixations being the best predictor of subjective detection, with a prediction accuracy rate of 78%. The combination of a temporal change in saccade amplitude and fixation duration averages also predicted detection in single viewing cases, with an accuracy of 68% The study discusses the use of eye movement measurements in video quality estimation and demonstrates that it is possible to predict subjective perception based on the stage of the task.

2016-02-06	Using electroencephalography to analyze sleepiness due to low-quality audiovisual stimuli	manuscripts	Signal Processing: Image Communication	Standardized methods to assess the quality of experience (QoE) of multimedia focus typically on short sequences of approximately 10 s and a subjective judgment of the test participant. Two main problems occur when using this methodology: On the one hand these short sequences do not represent the typical media usage, and on the other hand it is still not completely understood how these subjective ratings are formed within the test participant. To overcome the second issue and to gain insight into the internal processing, electroencephalography (EEG) has been introduced successfully to the domain of QoE. As it is possible to use EEG to assess the quality perception continuously, we present two studies using standard documentary audiovisual clips with a length of 40 min and 60 min as stimuli. During the presentation of these quality-wise manipulated test sequences, we record an electroencephalogram and other physiological measures. We show that features of the EEG recordings indicate a change in the cognitive state of the test participant during the exposure to low-quality compared to high-quality sequences.

2014-03-21	Using Electroencephalography to Measure Perceived Video Quality	manuscripts	Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing	Using less bandwidth on the one hand and delivering high quality content on the other hand is one of the big goals for video service providers. Standardized rating tests are commonly used to quantify audiovisual quality. In order to better understand the neuronal processes underlying these quality ratings physiological measures may provide insights. This paper shows results of a series of studies using a physiological measurement, namely electroencephalography (EEG), combined with standard rating methods. The experiments follow an incremental approach in stimuli selection, ranging from purely visual to audiovisual stimuli. Results show that EEG is a feasible complement measurement technique to assess audiovisual quality as we achieve high correlation values between subjective and physiological data consistently through all experiments.

2013-07-31	Single-trial analysis of the neural correlates of speech quality perception	manuscripts	J. Neural Eng.	Objective. Assessing speech quality perception is a challenge typically addressed in behavioral and opinion-seeking experiments. Only recently, neuroimaging methods were introduced, which were used to study the neural processing of quality at group level. However, our electroencephalography (EEG) studies show that the neural correlates of quality perception are highly individual. Therefore, it became necessary to establish dedicated machine learning methods for decoding subject-specific effects. Approach. The effectiveness of our methods is shown by the data of an EEG study that investigates how the quality of spoken vowels is processed neurally. Participants were asked to indicate whether they had perceived a degradation of quality (signal-correlated noise) in vowels, presented in an oddball paradigm. Main results. We find that the P3 amplitude is attenuated with increasing noise. Single-trial analysis allows one to show that this is partly due to an increasing jitter of the P3 component. A novel classification approach helps to detect trials with presumably non-conscious processing at the threshold of perception. We show that this approach uncovers a non-trivial confounder between neural hits and neural misses. Significance. The combined use of EEG signals and machine learning methods results in a significant 'neural' gain in sensitivity (in processing quality loss) when compared to standard behavioral evaluation; averaged over 11 subjects, this amounts to a relative improvement in sensitivity of 35%.

2012-03-23	Analyzing Speech Quality Perception Using Electroencephalography	manuscripts	Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing	Common speech quality evaluation methods rely on self-reported opinions after perceiving test stimuli. Whereas these methods-when carefully applied-provide valid and reliable quality indices, they provide little insight into the processes underlying perception and judgment. In this paper, we analyze the performance of electroencephalography (EEG) for indicating different types of degradations in speech stimuli. We show that a certain EEG technique, event-related-potentials (ERP) analysis, is a useful and valid tool in quality research. Three experiments are reported which show that quality degradations can be monitored in conscious and presumably non-conscious stages of processing. Potential and limitations of the approach are discussed and lines of future research are drawn.	Antons, J.-N., Schleicher, R., Arndt, S., Möller, S., Porbadnigk, A. K. & Curio, G.

This feature could enhance XR devices’ social acceptability and social presence when communicating with others outside the XR experience. In this pilot study, we explore the implications of the EyeSight feature by examining social acceptability, social presence, emotional responses, and technology acceptance. Eight participants engaged in conversational tasks in three conditions to contrast experiencing the Apple Vision Pro with EyeSight, the Meta Quest 3 as a reference XR headset, and a face-to-face setting. Our preliminary findings indicate that while the EyeSight feature improves perceptions of social presence and acceptability compared to the reference headsets, it does not match the social connectivity of direct human interactions.

2024-08-01	VR Cloud Gaming UX: Exploring the Impact of Network Quality on Emotion, Presence, Game Experience and Cybersickness	conferences	 23rd IEEE International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality (ISMAR 2024)	This study explores the user experience (UX) of virtual reality (VR) cloud gaming under simulated network degradation conditions. Two contrasting games (Beat Saber, Cubism) were streamed via Meta Air Link to a Quest 3 device in a laboratory setup. Packet loss and delay were introduced into the streaming network using NetEm for WiFi traffic manipulation. In a within-subjects experiment, 16 participants played both games under three network conditions (Loss, Delay, Baseline), followed by post-game questionnaires assessing their emotions, perceived quality, game experience, sense of presence, and cybersickness. Friedman's test and Dunn's post-hoc test for pairwise comparisons revealed that packet loss had a greater impact on UX than delay across almost all evaluated aspects. Notably, packet loss in Beat Saber led to a significant increase in cybersickness, whereas in Cubism, players experienced a significant reduction in their sense of presence. Additionally, both games exhibited statistically significant variations between conditions in most game experience dimensions, perceived quality, and emotional responses. This study highlights the critical role of network stability in VR cloud gaming, particularly in minimizing packet loss. The different dynamics between the games suggest the possibility of genre-specific optimization and novel game design considerations for VR cloud games.

Having a precise speech recognition mechanism, our virtual character performs a mock-up software engineering job interview to adequately immerse the user in a life-like scenario. To evaluate the efficiency of our system, we measure factors such as the provoked level of anxiety, social presence, self-esteem, and intrinsic motivation. This research is a work in progress with a prospective within-subject user study including approximately 40 participants. All users will engage with three job interview conditions (VR, AR, and desktop) and provide their feedback. Additionally, users' bio-physical responses will be collected using a biosensor to measure the level of anxiety during the job interview.

We conducted a within-subject user study with 43 participants who engaged with and rated the usability of our system and participated in a post-experiment interview to collect subjective data. Our findings showed significantly higher usability and higher pragmatic quality ratings for the single tablet condition. However, some users attribute a higher level of presence to the avatar and prefer it to be placed on a second tablet.	Ashrafi, N., Hinzmann, S.

2024-04-25	Investigating the impact of virtual element misalignment in collaborative Augmented Reality experiences	conferences	16th International Conference on Quality of Multimedia Experience (QoMEX 2024)	The collaboration in co-located shared environments has sparked an increased interest in immersive technologies, including Augmented Reality (AR). Since research in this field has primarily focused on individual user experiences in AR, the collaborative aspects within shared AR spaces remain less explored, and fewer studies can provide guidelines for designing this type of experience. This article investigates how the user experience in a collaborative shared AR space is affected by divergent perceptions of virtual objects and the effects of positional synchrony and avatars. For this purpose, we developed an AR app and used two distinct experimental conditions to study the influencing factors. Forty-eight participants, organized into 24 pairs, participated in the experiment and jointly interacted with shared virtual objects. Results indicate that divergent perceptions of virtual objects did not directly influence communication and collaboration dynamics. Conversely, positional synchrony emerged as a critical factor, significantly enhancing the quality of the collaborative experience. On the contrary, while not negligible, avatars played a relatively less pronounced role in influencing these dynamics. The findings can potentially offer valuable practical insights, guiding the development of future collaborative AR/VR environments.	Vona, F., Hinzmann, S. L., Stern, M., Ćeranić, M., Grieshammer, D.

2024-04-25	Comparing Continuous and Retrospective Emotion Ratings in Remote VR Study	conferences	16th International Conference on Quality of Multimedia Experience (QoMEX 2024)	This study investigates the feasibility of remote virtual reality (VR) studies conducted at home using VR headsets and video conferencing by deploying an experiment on emotion ratings. 20 participants used head-mounted displays to immerse themselves in 360° videos selected to evoke emotional responses. The research compares continuous ratings using a graphical interface to retrospective questionnaires on a digitized Likert Scale for measuring arousal and valence, both based on the self-assessment manikin (SAM). It was hypothesized that the two different rating methods would lead to significantly different values for both valence and arousal. The goal was to investigate whether continuous ratings during the experience would better reflect users' emotions compared to the post-questionnaire by mitigating biases such as the peak-end rule. The results show significant differences with moderate to strong effect sizes for valence and no significant differences for arousal with low to moderate effect sizes. This indicates the need for further investigation of the methods used to assess emotion ratings in VR studies. Overall, this study is an example of a remotely conducted VR experiment, offering insights into methods for emotion elicitation in VR by varying the timing and interface of the rating.

2024-04-25	The Impact of Social Environment and Interaction Focus on User Experience and Social Acceptability of an Augmented Reality Game	conferences	16th International Conference on Quality of Multimedia Experience (QoMEX 2024)	One of the most promising technologies inside the Extended Reality (XR) spectrum is Augmented Reality. This technology is already in people's pockets regarding Mobile Augmented Reality with their smartphones. The scientific community still needs answers about how humans could and should interact in environments where perceived stimuli are different from fully physical or digital circumstances. Moreover, it is still being determined if people accept these new technologies in different social environments and interaction settings or if some obstacles could exist. This paper explores the impact of the Social Environment and the Focus of social interaction on users while playing a location-based augmented reality game, measuring it with user experience and social acceptance indicators. An empirical study in a within-subject fashion was performed in different social environments and under different settings of social interaction focus with N = 28 participants compiling self-reported questionnaires after playing a Scavenger Hunt in Augmented Reality. The measures from two different Social Environments (Crowded vs. Uncrowded) resulted in statistically relevant mean differences with indicators from the Social Acceptability dimension. Moreover, the analyses show statistically relevant differences between the variances from different degrees of Social Interaction Focus with Overall Social Presence, Perceived Psychological Engagement, Perceived Attentional Engagement, and Perceived Emotional Contagion. The results suggest that a location-based AR game played in different social environments and settings can influence the user experience's social dimension. Therefore, they should be carefully considered while designing immersive technological experiences in public spaces involving social interactions between players.

2024-05-11	Experiencing Dynamic Weight Changes in Virtual Reality Through Pseudo-Haptics and Vibrotactile Feedback	conferences	Annual conference on Computer-Human Interaction (CHI 2024)	Virtual reality (VR) objects react dynamically to users’ touch interactions in real-time. However, experiencing changes in weight through the haptic sense remains challenging with consumer VR controllers due to their limited vibrotactile feedback. While prior works successfully applied pseudo-haptics to perceive absolute weight by manipulating the control-display (C/D) ratio, we continuously adjusted the C/D ratio to mimic weight changes. Vibrotactile feedback additionally emphasises the modulation in the virtual object’s physicality. In a study (N=18), we compared our multimodal technique with pseudo-haptics alone and a baseline condition to assess participants’ experiences of weight changes. Our findings demonstrate that participants perceived varying degrees of weight change when the C/D ratio was adjusted, validating its effectiveness for simulating dynamic weight in VR. However, the additional vibrotactile feedback did not improve weight change perception. This work extends the understanding of designing haptic experiences for lightweight VR systems by leveraging perceptual mechanisms	Stellmacher, C., Pujianto, F.

2024-04-15	Influence of Gameplay Duration, Hand Tracking, and Controller Based Control Methods on UX in VR	conferences	 16th International Workshop on Immersive Mixed and Virtual Environment Systems (MMVE ’24)	Inside-out tracking is growing popular in consumer VR, enhancing accessibility. It uses HMD camera data and neural networks for effective hand tracking. However, limited user experience studies have compared this method to traditional controllers, with no consensus on the optimal control technique. This paper investigates the impact of control methods and gaming duration on VR user experience, hypothesizing hand tracking might be preferred for short sessions and by users new to VR due to its simplicity. Through a lab study with twenty participants, evaluating presence, emotional response, UX quality, and flow, findings revealed control type and session length affect user experience without significant interaction. Controllers were generally superior, attributed to their reliability, and longer sessions increased presence and realism. The study found that individuals with more VR experience were more inclined to recommend hand tracking to others, which contradicted predictions.

This study explores how virtual characters impact motivation for well-being. Three prototypes with cartoon, robotic, and human-like avatars were tested by 22 participants. Results show that animated virtual avatars, especially with extended reality, boost motivation, enhance comprehension of activities, and heighten presence. Multiple output modalities, like audio and text, with character animations, improve the user experience. Notably, the cartoon-like character evoked positive responses. This research highlights virtual characters' potential to engage individuals in daily well-being activities.	Kojić, T., Vergari, M., Podratz, M., Möller, S. & Voigt-Antons, J.-N.

We asked 30 users to converse with a virtual assistant who gives recommendations about city activities. The participants interacted with two different personalities: Sammy, a cheerful blue mouse, and Olive, a serious green human-like agent. Each was presented with two body languages - happy/friendly and annoyed/unfriendly. We conclude how agent representation and humor affect User Experience aspects, and that body language is significant in the evaluation and perception of the AR agent.	Koleva, K.

2023-07-18	Exploring users' sense of safety in public using an Augmented Reality application	conferences	15th International Conference on Quality of Multimedia Experience (QoMEX 2023)	Nowadays, Augmented Reality (AR) is available on almost all smartphones creating some exciting interaction opportunities but also challenges. For example, already after the famous AR app Pokemon GO was released in July 2016, numerous accidents related to the use of the app were reported by users. At the same time, the spread of AR can be noticed in the tourism industry, enabling tourists to explore their surroundings in new ways but also exposing them to safety issues. This preliminary study explores users' sense of safety when manipulating the amount and UI elements visualization parameters of Point of Interest (POI) markers in a developed AR application. The results show that the amount of POI markers that are displayed is significant for participants' sense of safety. The influence of manipulating UI elements in terms of “transparency”, “color”, and “size” cannot be proven. Nevertheless, most tested people stated that manipulating transparency and size somehow influences their sense of safety, so a closer look at them should be taken in future studies.

Whereas anonymization techniques were shown to be prone to data re-identification, synthetic data generation has gradually replaced anonymization since it is relatively less time and resource-consuming and more robust to data leakage. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been used for generating synthetic datasets, especially GAN frameworks adhering to the differential privacy phenomena. This research compares state-of-the-art GAN-based models for synthetic data generation to generate time-series synthetic medical records of dementia patients which can be distributed without privacy concerns. Predictive modeling, autocorrelation, and distribution analysis are used to assess the Quality of Generating (QoG) of the generated data. The privacy preservation of the respective models is assessed by applying membership inference attacks to determine potential data leakage risks. Our experiments indicate the superiority of the privacy-preserving GAN (PPGAN) model over other models regarding privacy preservation while maintaining an acceptable level of QoG. The presented results can support better data protection for medical use cases in the future.	Ashrafi, N., Schmitt, V., Spang, R. P., Möller, S. & Voigt-Antons, J.-N.

2023-07-18	An Investigation of the Influence of Ambient Noise on User Experience in Virtual Reality	conferences	15th International Conference on Quality of Multimedia Experience (QoMEX 2023)	Although there are several aspects that might impact one's feeling of immersion or presence in a virtual environment, noises in the actual world are often overlooked. Distractions (such as noises or lights) may have an effect on a person's mental or emotional state in real life, and these interruptions can be disturbing while trying to focus on work. With a steady stream of distractions, one may eventually lose interest and make mistakes or stop the activity. The goal of this research is to better understand the impact of various ambient sounds on presence, immersion, and decision-making by using virtual reality and audio rendering technology. This study's sound sources were obtained and recorded from several real-life sources before being mixed into the virtual world. These audio recordings have been shown to influence a person's decision-making skills by generating a sudden shift in different emotional states (such as annoyance and anger). In certain circumstances, binaural recording is used to provide the listener with a 3D stereo sound experience. They were triggered at random intervals while the user was in the virtual environment. Based on the findings of the study presented in this paper, some types of noises, such as continuous and impulsive noise, have a negative impact on user experience by reducing immersion in the virtual reality environment. It was also discovered that the more interaction there was, the more mental work was required to complete the activities.	Kojic, T., Vergari, M., Vona, F., Voigt-Antons, J.-N. & Möller, S.

2022-10-04	The Story time Dataset: Simulated Videotelephony Clips for Quality Perception Research	conferences	14th International Conference on Quality of Multimedia Experience (QoMEX 2022)	To study people's natural behavior during different conditions of audiovisual quality, we usually invite people into a lab and let them talk to each other. In such conversation settings, not only the media quality impacts the quality perception, but, e.g., social aspects of a real conversation are reflected by individual conversational and rating behavior. Hence, to study quality perception in conversational settings, we try to create an environment that isolates the media quality from such outside factors and is consistent for each participant in the lab. Therefore, we created a dataset of simulated videotelephony clips to act as stimuli in quality perception research. The dataset consists of four different stories in the German language that are told through ten consecutive parts, each about 10 seconds long. Each of these parts is available in four different quality levels, ranging from perfect to stalling. All clips (FullHD, H.264 / AAC) are actual recordings from end-user video-conference software to ensure ecological validity and realism of quality degradation. To ensure consistency among different clips of the same quality level, each video has been scored using VMAF and POLQA and selected to match predefined selection criteria. To analyze the perceived quality of the clips, we conducted a user study (N=25) and evaluated perceived quality, interest in the stories, and speaker engagement. Results validate the consistency of the quality levels of the video clips. Apart from a detailed description of the methodological approach, we contribute the entire stimuli dataset containing 160 videos and all rating scores for each file.	Spang, R.

2022-10-04	Investigation of Personal Space perception in Augmented Reality	conferences	14th International Conference on Quality of Multimedia Experience (QoMEX 2022)	Over the past five years, the interest in Augmented Reality (AR) technologies has significantly increased. Different industries adopted it, such as gaming, tourism, e-commerce, and entertainment, to name a few. Due to its non-fully immersive property, easy implementation, and compatibility with the most recent smartphones, AR seems to be suitable for daily usage. This poses a significant challenge in creating a good User Experience (UX), as this kind of technology needs to be designed for private scenarios and public ones. In its context, it is essential to understand how users are influenced in their social interactions while using AR. Through the use of humanoid Virtual Characters, this paper is intended to better the understanding of how people perceive personal space in AR. By varying Virtual Character Gender (male, female) and its Placement Modality (predefined, dynamic distance) in the real environment, the effects on UX, Emotions, and Social Presence are investigated. As Personal Space is a dynamic psychological construct, which could depend on individual factors, this paper further investigates some possible co-variant effects of users' preferences towards a female or a male character based on their Sexual Attraction. Results show that Placement Modality significantly affects Personal Space boundaries in terms of position, width, and hedonic quality of the experience. Moreover, an effect of Virtual Character Gender was found on users' Personal Space inner boundary, and Social Presence in its emotional contagion dimension. Finally, an effect of Sexual Attraction on UX, Social Presence in its emotional contagion dimension, and dominance were discovered.	Vergari, M., Spang, R.

2021-05-10	Don't Worry be Happy - Using virtual environments to induce emotional states measured by subjective scales and heart rate parameters	conferences	IEEE Conference on Virtual Reality and 3D User Interfaces (IEEE VR 2021)	Advancing technology and higher availability of Virtual Reality (VR) devices sparked its application in various research fields. For instance, health-related research showed that simulated nature environments in VR could reduce arousal and increase valence levels. This study investigates how the amount of possible interactivity influences the presence in nature environments and consequences on arousal and valence. After inducing fear (high arousal and low valence) through a VR-horror game, it was tested how participants recovered if they played a VR-nature game with either no, limited, or extensive interaction. The horror game proved to be a valid stimulus for inducing high arousal and low valence with a successful manipulation check. Igroup presence questionnaire (IPQ) scores showed that more interaction with the virtual environment increases spatial presence. A beneficial effect of experiencing nature can also be concluded. Results from the Self-Assessment Manikin questionnaire (SAM) scores for valence indicate a significant increase in the conditions with extensive and limited interaction compared to the control group. The VR Nature experience did significantly decrease arousal and increase valence compared to the post-horror game ratings. The physiological responses support this finding. These results can increase the effectiveness of health-related VR-applications to elevate mood levels by either implementing plenty of interactions and consequently increasing spatial presence or doing the opposite and leaving out any interactions at all.

2021-05-10	Influence of Interactivity and Social Environments on User Experience and Social Acceptability in Virtual Reality	conferences	IEEE Conference on Virtual Reality and 3D User Interfaces (IEEE VR 2021)	Nowadays, Virtual Reality (VR) technology can be potentially used everywhere through wearable head-mounted displays. Nevertheless, it is still uncommon to see VR devices used in public settings. In these contexts, unaware bystanders in the surroundings might influence the User Experience (UX) and create concerns about the social acceptability of this technology. The user acts in a Social Environment (SE), characterized by surrounding people's number, proximity, and behavior. Simultaneously, VR applications often require a different degree of interactivity concerning body movements and controllers interaction. In this paper, the influence of Social Environments, and degree of interactivity on User Experience and social acceptability is investigated. Four Social Environments were simulated employing 360° Videos, and two VR games developed with two levels of interactivity. Results showed a statistically significant influence of Social Environments on Overall UX as well as Public VR, Interaction, Isolation, Privacy and Safety acceptability, and of the degree of interactivity on Presence, Valence, Arousal, Overall UX, UX Hedonic quality, and Safety acceptability. Findings indicate that Social Environments and degree of interactivity should be taken into account while designing VR applications.

2021-01-15	Exploring Visualisations for Financial Statements in Virtual Reality	conferences	IEEE International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Virtual Reality (AIVR 2020)	Recent developments in Virtual Reality (VR) provide vast opportunities for data visualization. Individuals must be motivated to understand the data presented concerning their personal financial statements, as with better understanding comes more efficient money management and a healthier future-minded focus on planning for their personal finances. This paper aims to investigate how a 3D in VR visualization scenario influences an immersed users' capability to understand and engage with personal financial statement data in comparison to a scenario where a user would be interacting with 2D personal financial statement data on paper. This was achieved by creating a 2D paper prototype data and utilizing the benefits of 3D in a VR prototype visualization. Both prototypes consisted of chart representations of personal financial statement data, which were tested in a user study. Also, participants (N=23) were given a set of tasks (such as ”Find the quarter in which the least amount of expenses was spent”) to solve by using 2D or 3D financial statements. Results show that participants reported interaction is statistically significant more natural with 2D data on paper than interactions with 3D data in VR. Also, participants reported that they perceived statistically significant more considerable delay between outcome and their action with 3D data in VR. However, effectiveness, measured by the percentage of correctly solved tasks, in both versions enabled participants to answer almost all given tasks successfully. Those results are showing that VR as a medium could be used for analyzing financial statements. In future developments, several additional directions could be incorporated. Exploring data visualization is essential not only for the financial sector but also for other domains such as taxes or law reports.	Kojić, T., Ashipala, S., Möller, S. & Voigt-Antons, J.-N.

2020-06-23	Comparing Emotional States Induced by 360° Videos Via Head-Mounted Display and Computer Screen	conferences	12th International Conference on Quality of Multimedia Experience (QoMEX 2020)	In recent years 360° videos have been becoming more popular. For traditional media presentations, e.g., on a computer screen, a wide range of assessment methods are available. Different constructs, such as perceived quality or the induced emotional state of viewers, can be reliably assessed by subjective scales. Many of the subjective methods have only been validated using stimuli presented on a computer screen. This paper is using 360° videos to induce varying emotional states. Videos were presented 1) via a head-mounted display (HMD) and 2) via a traditional computer screen. Furthermore, participants were asked to rate their emotional state 1) in retrospect on the self-assessment manikin scale and 2) continuously on a 2-dimensional arousal-valence plane. In a repeated measures design, all participants (N = 18) used both presentation systems and both rating systems. Results indicate that there is a statistically significant difference in induced presence due to the presentation system. Furthermore, there was no statistically significant difference in ratings gathered with the two presentation systems. Finally, it was found that for arousal measures, a statistically significant difference could be found for the different rating methods, potentially indicating an underestimation of arousal ratings gathered in retrospect for screen presentation. In the future, rating methods such as a 2-dimensional arousal-valence plane could offer the advantage of enabling a reliable measurement of emotional states while being more embedded in the experience itself, enabling a more precise capturing of the emotional states.

2020-06-23	Impact of Tactile and Visual Feedback on Breathing Rhythm and User Experience in VR Exergaming	conferences	12th International Conference on Quality of Multimedia Experience (QoMEX 2020)	Combining interconnected wearables provides fascinating opportunities like augmenting exergaming with virtual coaches, feedback on the execution of sports activities, or how to improve on them. Breathing rhythm is a particularly interesting physiological dimension since it is easy and unobtrusive to measure and gained data provide valuable insights regarding the correct execution of movements, especially when analyzed together with additional movement data in real-time. In this work, we focus on indoor rowing since it is a popular sport that's often done alone without extensive instructions. We compare a visual breathing indication with haptic guidance in order for athletes to maintain a correct, efficient, and healthy breathing-movement-synchronicity (BMS) while working out. Also, user experience and acceptance of the different modalities were measured. The results show a positive and statistically significant impact of purely verbal instructions and purely tactile feedback on BMS and no significant impact of visual feedback. Interestingly, the subjective ratings indicate a strong preference for the visual modality and even an aversion for the haptic feedback, although objectively the performance benefited most from using the latter.

The developed tool, called Morph A Mood (MAM), consists of a 3D character whose facial expression can be adjusted with simple controller gestures according to the perceived affective state to capture valence and arousal scores. It was tested against the questionnaires Pick-A-Mood (PAM) and Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM) in an experiment in which the participants (N = 32) watched several one-minute excerpts from music videos of the DEAP database within a virtual environment and assessed their mood after each clip. The experiment showed a high correlation with regard to valence, but only a moderate one with regard to arousal. No statistically significant differences were found between the SAM ratings of this experiment and MAM, but between the valence values of MAM and the DEAP database and between the arousal values of MAM and PAM. In terms of user experience, MAM and PAM hardly differ. Furthermore, the experiment showed that assessments inside virtual environments are significantly faster than with paper-pencil methods, where media devices such as headphones and display goggles must be put on and taken off.

2020-06-23	User Experience of Reading in Virtual Reality — Finding Values for Text Distance, Size and Contrast	conferences	12th International Conference on Quality of Multimedia Experience (QoMEX 2020)	Virtual Reality (VR) has an increasing impact on the market in many fields, from education and medicine to engineering and entertainment, by creating different applications that replicate or in the case of augmentation enhance real-life scenarios. Intending to present realistic environments, VR applications are including text that we are surrounded by every day. However, text can only add value to the virtual environment if it is designed and created in such a way that users can comfortably read it. With the aim to explore what values for text parameters users find comfortable while reading in virtual reality, a study was conducted allowing participants to manipulate text parameters such as font size, distance, and contrast. Therefore two different standalone virtual reality devices were used, Oculus Go and Quest, together with three different text samples: Short (2 words), medium (21 words), and long (51 words). Participants had the task of setting text parameters to the best and worst possible value. Additionally, participants were asked to rate their experience of reading in virtual reality. Results report mean values for angular size (the combination of distance and font size) and color contrast depending on the different device used as well as the varying text length, for both tasks. Significant differences were found for values of angular size, depending on the length of the displayed text. However, different device types had no significant influence on text parameters but on the experiences reported using the self-assessment manikin (SAM) scale.

One domain of games for virtual environments are exergames - a combination of exercising and gaming. For many exergames, users need to be instructed on how the exercise has to be performed correctly. In this study, a rowing simulation is extended by visualizations in VR that show constant live biofeedback information about the rowers current breathing patterns. In order to compare the effects of such additional information, several visualizations of biofeedback were designed: animation of lungs, line chart, and numerical breathing synchronization feedback. The main goal of the game for participants was to focus on their breathing rhythm and maintain it. Results show that helpfulness and sympathy were rated statistically significantly higher for the case of combined instructional elements compared to no elements. Moreover, participants rated rowing in VR statistically significantly higher on the sympathy scale compared to rowing without VR. Furthermore, flow was rated statistically significantly higher for the conditions including all instruction types. There was a significant decrease of task performance for conditions with performance visualizations. For future studies we are planning to use longer stimulus duration, greater than 10 minutes, due to this change we expect that a potential increase of task performance will manifest.

2019-08-01	Exploring Diachronic Changes of Biomedical Knowledge using Distributed Concept Representations	conferences	18th ACL Workshop on Biomedical Natural Language Processing (BioNLP 2019)	In research best practices can change over time as new discoveries are made and novel methods are implemented. Scientific publications reporting about the latest facts and current state-of-the-art can be possibly outdated after some years or even proved to be false. A publication usually sheds light only on the knowledge of the period it has been published. Thus, the aspect of time can play an essential role in the reliability of the presented information. In Natural Language Processing many methods focus on information extraction from text, such as detecting entities and their relationship to each other. Those methods mostly focus on the facts presented in the text itself and not on the aspects of knowledge which changes over time. This work instead examines the evolution in biomedical knowledge over time using scientific literature in terms of diachronic change. Mainly the usage of temporal and distributional concept representations are explored and evaluated by a proof-of-concept.	Vashisth, G., Mikhailov, M., Voigt-Antons, J.-N. & Roller, R.

2019-06-24	Influence of Network Delay in Virtual Reality Multiplayer Exergames: Who is actually delayed?	conferences	11th International Conference on Quality of Multimedia Experience (QoMEX 2019)	One of the fields where Virtual Reality (VR) is finding a potentially growing market is in the combination of exercising and gaming - also called exergaming. When it comes to competition in gaming, is important to investigate how different levels of delay influence overall quality of experience (QoE) in VR multiplayer exergames. The experimental setup consisted of a VR application coupled with a rowing ergometer, allowing races between the user and an artificially created opponent that is following the player with a similar speed and keeping the race tight. To investigate the influence of the delay, on both user's and opponent's side three levels of network delay were introduced (30ms, 100ms, and 500ms) and mixed throughout different conditions. After each session, participants rated perceived flow, sense of presence, and the degree to which they have noticed the delay in their or the opponent's system. Interestingly, results show different perception of delay and QoE depending on user's own delay. Participants perceived the opponent's player as being delayed even if only the player itself had network delay along with significantly lower rating of QoE only when their delay was high.

2019-06-24	Influence of UI Complexity and Positioning on User Experience During VR Exergames	conferences	11th International Conference on Quality of Multimedia Experience (QoMEX 2019)	In past years, as virtual reality (VR) technology is extensively developing, more and more people are using it in different fields. One of the fast developing fields in VR are exergames, a combination of physical exercise and game. With a goal to engage people in physical activity, VR exergames should look and feel good for users. Therefore, user interface (UI) in VR is important and has to be built in a way to enhance user experience. In this paper, ergometer is used together with VR rowing environment as VR exergame for a study aiming to explore possibilities of UI in VR. Accordingly, different metrics commonly used to quantify rowing action (e.g, speed and distance) were visualized. The visualizations that were created had different positioning (closer or further away from the player) and different level of complexity (more or less metrics shown as only numbers or in a gamified design). Participants (N = 27) during experiment for this study rowed four times in different conditions depending were metrics of the game were shown: 1) as a cockpit at the front of the rowing e.g, with gamified visualization of metrics; 2) as a coach boat that follows the player with gamified visualization of metrics on a screen; 3) as a cockpit at the front of the rowing e.g, with digital visualization of metrics; 4) as a coach boat that follows the player with digital visualization of metrics on a screen. Results show that level of UI complexity has a significant influence on readability, while positioning of UI elements significantly influences users' perception of support from system. Furthermore, participants preferred the opposite level of complexity depending on the position where metrics were shown.	Kojić, T., Sirotina, U., Möller, S. & Voigt-Antons, J.-N.

2019-06-24	Emotional Impact of Video Quality: Self-Assessment and Facial Expression Recognition	conferences	10th International Conference on Quality of Multimedia Experience (QoMEX 2019)	As known from everyday contexts of multimedia usage, suddenly occurring quality impairments are capable of causing strong negative emotions in human users. This is particularly the case if the displayed content is highly relevant to current motives and behavioral goals. The present study investigated the effects of visual degradations on quality perception and emotional state of participants who were exposed to a series of short video clips. After each video playback, participants had to decide whether a certain event happened in the video. For data collection, subjective measures of quality and emotion were complemented by behavioral measures derived from capturing participants' spontaneous facial expressions. For data analysis, two general approaches were combined: First, a multivariate analysis of variance approach allowed to examine the effects of visual degradation factors on perceived quality and subjective emotional dimensions. It mainly revealed that perceived quality and emotional valence were both sensitive to degradation intensity, whereas the impact of degradation length was limited when task-relevant video content had already been obscured. Second, using a machine learning approach, an automatic Video Quality of Experience (VQoE) prediction system based on the recorded facial expressions was derived, demonstrating a strong correlation between facial expressions and perceived quality. Hereby, estimates of VQoE might be delivered in an objective, continuous and concealed manner, thus diminishing any further need for subjective self-reports.

2018-10-19	Using Virtual Reality and Head-Mounted Displays to Increase Performance in Rowing Workouts	conferences	1th International Workshop on Multimedia Content Analysis in Sports	Technology is advancing rapidly in the domain of virtual reality, as well as in using sensors to gather feedback from our body and the environment we are interacting in. Combining these two technologies gives us the opportunity to create personalized and reactive immersive environments. These environments can be used for training of dangerous situations (e.g. fire, crashes, etc) or to improve skills with less distraction than regular natural environments would offer. The pilot study described in this paper, puts an athlete rowing on a stationary rowing machine into a virtual environment. The virtual reality receives movement data from several sensors of the rowing machine and displays those in the head-mounted display. In addition, metrics on technique are derived from the sensor data as well as physiological data. All this is used to investigate if and to which extend VR improves the technical skills of an athlete, during the complex sport of rowing. Furthermore, athletes are given subjective feedback about their performance comparing the standard rowing workout with the workout using VR. First results indicate improved performance of the workout and an enhanced experience for the athlete in the VR condition.	Arndt, S., Perkis, A. & Voigt-Antons, J.-N.

2018-09-13	Influence of Virtual Environments and Conversations on User Engagement During Multiplayer Exergames	conferences	10th International Conference on Quality of Multimedia Experience (QoMEX 2018)	Virtual Reality (VR) multiplayer games are currently developed more frequently, while in parallel VR is becoming more accessible to the broader public. Also exergames, which refer to computer games combined with a physical activity, are getting widely available, driven by developments in sensor technologies. In this paper, we present results of a multiplayer exergame experiment where two players race against each other four times on two rowing ergometers. Experimental conditions were type of environment (with VR vs. without VR) and the possibility of conversation with the opponent (conversation enabled vs. conversation disabled). To measure subjective experience, participants rated perceived flow, sense of presence and social presence on standardized questionnaires. Results show that the type of environment has a significant influence on the perceived presence, as participants rated the presence higher in VR. The possibility of conversation resulted in a perception of a significantly higher social presence. This illustrates that the usage of virtual environments as well as the possibility of conversations between users are highly valuable to increase the Quality of Experience during exergames. In our future research, we plan to further investigate means to improve the user experience by applying gamification, different representations of opponents, and to assess the impact of network impairments during multiplayer scenarios.

2018-09-13	User Experience of Web Browsing - The Relationship of Usability and Quality of Experience	conferences	10th International Conference on Quality of Multimedia Experience (QoMEX 2018)	The experience of web services depends on multiple factors such as the usability of the service itself as well as influences on Quality of Experience (QoE) like waiting times. Existing studies so far have investigated both experimental factors (usability and QoE) in isolation, thus it is not possible to investigate dependencies between the two. In this study, we manipulated the usability and QoE of a news web page in the same experiment. Participants had to solve 9 tasks (three usability level and three QoE level, all combinations). Data (N=44) from two different sessions with different QoE manipulations were recorded: Simulation of initial page display delay via 1) a complete overlay and 2) a semi-transparent overlay. Our preliminary results show that the usability manipulation resulted in significant effects along multiple dimensions (QoE, aesthetic, and usability). Furthermore, also the implementation of the QoE manipulation had an effect on, e.g., performance parameters. Surprisingly, our results reveal that participants seem to be unable to rate the constructs usability and QoE independently from each other. Even after adding pronounced explanations of the constructs to the introductory phase of the second session of the experiment, the results still show a strong correlation between the two constructs. We thus recommend for similar future experiments to check beforehand whether Quality of Experience and Usability can be reliably judged and distinguished by naive participants.

2018-09-13	Dissociating Perceptual Quality Dimensions of Transmitted Speech Using Electroencephalography	conferences	10th International Conference on Quality of Multimedia Experience (QoMEX 2018)	The present study utilized electroencephalography (EEG) to explore the neuro-electrical correlates of perceptual dimensions underlying speech quality. Specific focus lay on the P300 event-related brain potential (ERP) component to provide indication for internal processes related to attention and stimulus categorization. A high-quality (HQ) recording of a spoken word was impaired on each of three perceptual dimensions at a time, “discontinuity” (F), “noisiness” (N) and “coloration” (C), with F being realized through random erasure of distinct frames in the speech signal parts of the audio file. In an active three-stimulus oddball task, repeated presentations of the HQ stimulus led to the formation of a sensory/perceptual HQ reference, which was interrupted by infrequent occurrences of degraded “oddball” stimuli (F, N, C). Initial analysis of the obtained subjective and electrophysiological data suggested the following conclusions: 1) Participants perceived the three degraded stimuli as clearly impaired, but equal in terms of degradation intensity. Thus, variations in neural responses were assumed to reflect changes in the perceptual dimension along which the speech degradation had been induced. 2) Timing of the evoked P300 corresponded with temporal differences in the impairments, implying a later onset for “discretely” (F) compared to “continuously” (N, C) degraded stimuli after being categorized as task-irrelevant. Hence, P300 peak latency might prove useful to dissociate both classes of speech quality impairments on a neural level of analysis.	Uhrig, S., Möller & Voigt-Antons, J.-N.

2018-09-13	Impact of Virtual Environments on Motivation and Engagement During Exergames	conferences	10th International Conference on Quality of Multimedia Experience (QoMEX 2018)	Video games and sport are an essential part in the life of millions of people. With recent advances of immersive virtual reality devices such as the HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, or PlayStation VR, the use of virtual environments (VE) for exergames is becoming more and more popular. An exergame combines a physical activity with video game elements by tracking body movements or reactions of user, attempting to engage users in a more enjoyable system. In this paper, we present the results of a subjective experiment carried out with the aim to compare different kinds of virtual environments with each other. A rowing ergometer, connected either to a virtual reality system using a head-mounted display (HMD) or to a CAVE environment, was used as an exergame device. While for rowing experts, fitness and performance improvements are of major interest, we wanted to focus on the motivation and engagement of non-professionals. By means of a series of questionnaires and a follow-up interview, the Quality of Experience of participants using the system was assessed. Measurements include concepts such as flow, presence, video quality and well-being. Results show significant advantages of the HMD as well as of the CAVE compared to a system without a VE for the overall quality, system feedback, and flow. While the CAVE and HMD system mainly differed in their autotelic experience, the HMD was favored by the majority of participants due to a superior feeling of presence.

2018-09-13	Estimating Quality Ratings from Touch Interactions in Mobile Games	conferences	10th International Conference on Quality of Multimedia Experience (QoMEX 2018)	Obtaining reliable quality ratings for applications is a time-consuming and expensive process. Touch interaction data, however, can be recorded without additional effort when using mobile applications. It could be used to assess usability without having to conduct dedicated tests. This work investigates the possibility to estimate quality ratings for two mobile games solely from touch interactions without relying on performance or game logic measures. To capture pragmatic as well as hedonic quality aspects of usability as ground truth, the AttrakDiff Mini questionnaire was chosen. Two different simple mobile games were used to capture a variety of touch interactions (taps and swipes). To influence the user ratings, three versions of the games were presented: one in original quality, the two others with manipulated interaction quality. Touch interaction features were extracted from the recorded interaction data and used for training models using linear regression and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS). The models were built with three times 10-fold cross-validation on each game data set separately. The results indicate that the ratings for pragmatic quality are estimated significantly better than for hedonic quality and attractiveness. Furthermore, the transferability of the models from one game to the other was examined and the touch features that were most important for estimating quality ratings in this study were identified. Touch interactions seem to carry some information on usability, especially pragmatic quality, and it seems to be possible to estimate a broad direction of the user's usability perception. Just a few touch features carry the most information and can be used for simple but fast and powerful models. This could be applied as an automatic analytic tool for mobile applications as well as in adaptive applications that optimize themselves in terms of usability perceived by individual users.

2018-09-13	Effects of delay on perceived quality, behavior and oscillatory brain activity in dyadic telephone conversations	conferences	10th International Conference on Quality of Multimedia Experience (QoMEX 2018)	End-to-end delay is an important factor when studying the quality of modern packet-based telephone conversations. Other than most degradations, delay cannot be assessed by listen-only tests and mainly impacts the structure and interactivity of the conversation. Because of this, the modeling of the perceived quality of conversation under delay is dependent on various instrumental as well as human-related influencing factors. Physiological methods in particular might provide additional insights into how human participants are affected by such quality degradations during natural conversations. In the present experiment, a novel dual-electroencephalo-graphy (dual-EEG) method was employed to investigate the effects of delay on 10 pairs of participants engaging in dyadic conversations. In each test session, neurophysiological activity was registered simultaneously in both interlocutors, who interacted in accordance with short conversation test scenarios (SCIs) through an audio network. Meanwhile, delays of different magnitudes (0, 800, 1600 ms) were inserted into the network, which was expected to interfere with the conversation and cause changes in the participants' internal processing and state. Analysis of subjective and behavioral measures shows a decrease in perceived quality and of conversational interactivity with higher levels of delay. Moreover, an initial intra-brain analysis of the recorded dual-EEG data (N = 18) revealed significant modulations in beta and gamma frequency bands by varying delay level. This suggests that attentional load increased with high delay, probably due to less amounts of single talk and focusing more on the adaptation of the own turn-taking behavior.

2018-09-13	Predicting personality traits from touchscreen based interactions	conferences	10th International Conference on Quality of Multimedia Experience (QoMEX 2018)	Human influence factors can have a strong impact on how users perceive the quality of a given system. Traditional measures such as questionnaires can be a time consuming and partially invasive means to assess human influence factors like personality. In this paper, we investigate whether an individual's personality traits can be classified based solely upon the characteristics of their touchscreen usage. We record the tablet input of 75 subjects using a cognitive training application. The application requires the user to spell words by tapping on letters and dragging them to their denoted position on the screen. The task is presented in two conditions: in one with normal functionality of the program, the other with the usability of the application impaired. The subject's personality is measured with the NEO-FFI questionnaire and captured in the five dimensions of the five-factor model (Big 5). The personality scores and 68 features (touch-behavior and task-performance), as well as statistical metrics derived from them, are fed to a number of classification algorithms. Our results show that in a binary classification task with normal usability, high levels of `Neuroticism' can be distinguished from low levels with a mean accuracy of 66 percent. The extent to which a personality dimension can be predicted is dependent on the usability of the test system. In a normal setting, `Extraversion' can be predicted with an accuracy of 61 percent. However, with impaired usability, the prediction rises to an average of 67 percent. The experiment shows that records of touchscreen interactions allow for the prediction of personalities significantly better than random. The study of the human influence factor personality and its relation to perceived quality would be facilitated by using touchscreen interaction data as a fast and easily accessible estimate of a user's personality.

2017-05-13	Towards Prediction of User Experience from Touch Interactions with Mobile Applications	conferences	International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction (HCII)	In this work a first attempt is made to model user experience ratings with recordings of touch interactions. To measure the user experience the AttrakDiff Mini questionnaire is used providing three quality dimensions: pragmatic quality, hedonic quality and attractiveness. The feature selection for linear models shows that it is possible to predict the pragmatic quality for a test set with an  of up to 0.64. The hedonic quality and attractiveness, however, seem not to be reflected in these touch interactions in a linear way. Still, the results from this work constitute a promising direction for future research on assessing or even optimizing the user experience for apps automatically in real time.

2017-07-03	Exploring diverse measures for evaluating QoE in the context of WebRTC	conferences	9th International Conference on Quality of Multimedia Experience (QoMEX 2017)	Enabling high Quality of Experience (QoE) with video-conferencing solutions based on Web Real-Time Communication (WebRTC) protocols anywhere, anytime, is challenging and triggers the exploration of new ways to gain QoE insights. In this paper, we share initial observations from a within-subjects experiment (N = 22) in which 2-party WebRTC-based audiovisual conversations took place under varying technical conditions. We collected self-report data, peripheral physiological data and application-level performance statistics with the overall aim of exploring their usefulness and compatibility for assessing QoE in the context of WebRTC. Our preliminary findings indicate that the varying quality is well-reflected in the self-reported overall quality and annoyance. However, this might not apply when considering the emotional valence ratings and ECG data, implying that other factors may play a role here.	De Moor, K.

2016-08-31	Enhancing Video Streaming Using Real-Time Gaze Tracking	conferences	5th International Workshop on Perceptual Quality of Systems (PQS 2016)	This paper presents an innovative approach to the optimization of multimedia content delivery for future data intensive services, featuring an eye-gaze based paradigm for mobile video provision. The proposed solution uses real-time eyegaze information, collected by connected eye-trackers, to provide high resolution in the portion of a video frame corresponding to the central part of a user’s field of view and lower quality in the areas corresponding to the user’s peripheral vision. This approach brings new optimization opportunities, leading to significant reduction in terms of network and device resources needed to deliver high quality experience to the users. The initial results showed potential bandwidth savings on the order of 60%, while maintaining high levels of user perceived video quality. Relevant areas of application include head mounted displays for mobile virtual and augmented reality, where substantial resource consumption savings are anticipated due to their high screen resolutions. The paper also introduces and discusses few architectural embodiments as well as additional services enabled by this technology. The main focus is on utilizing the vast amount of eye-gaze information, accumulated during content provision, to build representative models for individual users’ attention and content consumption behaviors.

2016-02-01	Review on using physiology in quality of experience	conferences	International Symposium on Human Vision and Electronic Imaging (HVEI 2016)	In the area of Quality of Experience (QoE), one challenge is to design test methodologies in order to evaluate the perceived quality of multimedia content delivered through technical systems. Traditionally, this evaluation is done using subjective opinion tests. However, sometimes it is difficult for observers to communicate the experienced quality through the given scale. Furthermore, those tests do not give insights into how the user is reacting on an internal physiological level. To overcome these issues, one approach is to use physiological measures, in order to derive a direct non-verbal response of the recipient. In this paper, we review studies that have been performed in the domain of QoE using physiological measures and we look into current activities in standardization bodies. We present challenges this research faces, and give an overview on what researchers should be aware of when they want to start working in this research area.

Workshop on Quality of Multimedia Experience (QoMEX 2015)	How quality, quality perception and emotions are related, and what this may imply for research on Q, is a question that to date still lacks an unambiguous answer. The study of this relationship is challenging and requires validated emotional stimuli as well as suitable methods and tools to evaluate their emotional impact. This paper shares findings from an inter-laboratory study (N=39), in which electroencephalography data and self-report data on experienced affect, content likeability and perceived quality were collected to evaluate the emotional impact of stimuli from a publicly available database aimed at evoking certain emotional responses. The results call for caution when evaluating emotional impact of such stimuli, as both the self-reported and EEG data point to a number of influencing factors that interfere with the emotion elicitation and need to be taken into account in future research.

Workshop on Quality of Multimedia Experience (QoMEX 2015)	Physiological reactions to certain emotions make us feel warm or cold, thus there are strong bounds between emotions and temperature. However, within HCI research, using thermal information to evoke emotion related experiences is still rare. For the research presented in this paper a kidney belt with thermal actuators was developed in order to investigate the emotional responses to thermally augmented audiovisual stimuli (movie clips). Participants then continuously evaluated their emotional state via a tablet application on the dimensions “arousal” and “valence”. The results indicate that thermal stimulation has significant effects on the emotional experience of subjects. While emotions with negative valence are more prone to be affected on the arousal dimension, emotions with positive valence are significantly influenced on the valence dimension.

2015-07-06	Using electroencephalography and subjective self-assessment to measure the influence of quality variations in cloud gaming	conferences	7th Int. Workshop on Quality of Multimedia Experience (QoMEX 2015)	Subjective self-assessment is a frequently used method when it comes to Quality of Experience assessment in general. If correctly used a variety of scales can be applied to assess the quality of cloud gaming for different constructs such as experienced quality or flow. Besides self-assessment, physiological correlates are a promising method to measure the influence of cloud gaming quality on the player without the interruption introduced by the rating task. We present subjective and physiological results and lessons learned from a laboratory study in which 32 participants played a first person shooter game in a cloud gaming setup with varying levels of video quality caused by different video compression bitrates. We found that the video quality influenced the perceived quality, player experience, the valence rating, and the alpha frequency band power. It is shown that 1) subjective methods assess the quality variation and 2) physiological measures capture the influence on the player in terms of a reduced cognitive state. Taken together, test set-ups will benefit from a mixed methods approach in cloud gaming QoE testing.	Beyer, J., Varbelow, R., Antons, J.-N. & Möller, S.

The aim is to start a discussion amongst experts on potential evaluation methods and their limitations, before finalizing a Recommendation. Such a recommendation might in the end be applied by non-expert users, hence wrong decisions in the evaluation design could negatively affect gaming QoE throughout the evaluation.

Workshop on Quality of Multimedia Experience (QoMEX 2014)	Physiological measures such as electroencephalography (EEG) have been successfully introduced to the area of quality of experience. Most of these studies used short stimuli, and showed significant differences in the EEG signal between high quality and low quality conditions. The effect of longer low quality sequences, and how these affect the cognitive state, has not been studied extensively yet. The current paper reports on a study using longer audiovisual material and distorting audio as well as video. First results investigate whether the change in cognitive state can also be captured using subjective self-reports on the state of fatigue.	Arndt, S., Antons, J.-N. & Möller, S.

2014-12-15	Using eye-tracking and correlates of brain activity to predict quality scores	conferences	6th Int. Workshop on Quality of Multimedia Experience (QoMEX 2014)	Subjective quality tests give important information about the user's perception on the quality of an audio or video signal. These tests are helpful but usually lack information about the user's cognitive state. This might be crucial when consuming a service, as lower quality services may lead to a less frequent use. Therefore, physiological measures have become more popular in the domain of quality assessment as they give more detailed insights about e.g. fatigue and attention of a person. In the current study we used spatially degraded videos and obtained 1) standard subjective quality judgments, 2) eye movement parameters and 3) brain activity using electroencephalography (EEG). The results indicate more focused attention on the degraded area once participants found that area, as pupil diameter increases and the proportion of alpha activity decreases. On the basis of the data a model is proposed which predicts the quality scores from the obtained physiological measures.	Arndt, S., Radun, J., Antons, J.-N. & Möller, S.

2014-09-18	Characterization of human emotions and preferences for text-to-speech systems using multimodal neuroimaging methods	conferences	IEEE Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (CCECE 2014)	Voice user interface and speech quality are normally assessed using subjective user experience testing methods and/or objective instrumental techniques. However, the recent advances in neurophysiological tools allowed useful human behavioral constructs to be measured in real-time, such as human emotion, perception, preferences and task performance. Electroencephalography (EEG), and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) are well received neuroimaging tools and they are being used in variety of different domains such as health science, neuromarketing, user experience (UX) research and multimedia quality of experience (QoE) discipline. Therefore, this paper describes the impact of natural and text-to-speech (TTS) signals on a user's affective state (valence and arousal) and their preferences using neuroimaging tools (EEG and fNIRS) and subjective user study. The EEG results showed that the natural and high quality TTS speech generate “positive valence”, that was inferred from a higher EEG asymmetric activation at frontal head region. fNIRS results showed the increased activation at Orbito-Frontal Cortex (OFC) region during decision making in favor of natural and high quality TTS speech signals. But natural and TTS signals have significantly different arousal levels.	Rehman Laghari, K., Gupta, R., Arndt, S., Antons, J.-N., Möller, S. & Falk, T. H.

2014-06-05	Objective characterization of human behavioural characteristics for QoE assessment: A pilot study on the use of electroencephalography features	conferences	Globecom 2013 Workshop - Quality of Experience for Multimedia Communications (QoEMC 2013)	Quality of Experience (QoE) is a human-centric paradigm which produces the blue print of human behavioral states such as perception, emotion, cognition and expectation. Recent advances in neurophysiological monitoring tools have facilitated the study of frequency, time and location of neuronal activity to an unprecedented degree, as well as opened doors to a better understanding of human cognition, emotions and overall behavioral systems. These neurophysiological insights may provide more accurate and objective characterization of QoE metrics. This paper seeks to investigate neuronal activity generated by three different quality levels of a speech stimulus using electroen-cephalography (EEG). To this end, an electroencephalography (EEG) feature was computed based on the coupling between so-called delta and beta EEG frequency bands, which has previously been linked with negative behavioral characteristics (anxiety, frustration, dissatisfaction). The result indicates an increase in delta and beta coupling with a decrease in the speech quality levels. Additionally, neural correlates of a subjective affective scores (arousal and valence) were also computed and shown to be inversely proportional with EEG feature. These preliminary findings corroborate that emotions play a significant role in human quality and QoE perception.	Laghari, K., Gupta, R., Antons, J.-N., Schleicher, R., Möller, S. & Falk, T. H.

2014-01-02	The effects of text-to-speech system quality on emotional states and frontal alpha band power	conferences	6th International IEEE EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering	The tolerance limit for acceptable multimedia quality is changing as more and more high quality services approach the market. Thus, negative emotional reactions towards low quality services may cause user disappointment and are likely to increase churn rate. The current study analyzes how different levels of synthetic speech quality, obtained from different text-to-speech (TTS) systems, affect the emotional response of a user. This is achieved using two methods: subjective, by means of user reports; and neurophysiological by means of electroencephalography (EEG) analysis. More specifically, we analyzed the frontal alpha band power and correlated this with the subjective ratings based on the Self-Assessment Manikin scale. We found an increase in neuronal activity in the left frontal area with decreasing quality and argue that this is due to user disappointment with low quality TTS systems as they become harder to understand.

2013-09-04	 Effect of Questionnaire Order on Ratings of Perceived Quality and Experienced Affect	conferences	4th International Workshop on Perceptual Quality of Systems 	The assessment of perceived quality and experienced affect of users towards different audio and speech quality levels using subjective rating methods is a common and valid approach. In case that researchers are interested in the subjective a) quality and b) affective rating, participants have to rate the stimuli on both scales. Even though subject should just rate only one of the scales to be not influenced by the questions asked in the other questionnaire, researchers in practice frequently present various scales in a sequence to subjects. This paper examines the effect of questionnaire order on perceived quality and experienced affect by comparing the ratings of two groups of subjects which filled in questionnaires in different orders after listening to the same set of stimuli. We showed that the order of sequence had a significant effect on perceived quality and experienced affect as e.g. the quality of stimuli was rated lower if the quality rating not occurred instantly after stimulus presentation. Thus we want to create awareness for these effects and presented first guidelines to overcome them.	Antons, J.-N., Arndt, S. & Schleicher, R.	Antons, J.-N., Arndt, S. & Schleicher, R.

2013-09-04	Does Low Quality Audiovisual Content Increase Fatigue of Viewers?	conferences	4th International Workshop on Perceptual Quality of Systems 	While most quality studies measure purely the subjectively perceived quality of videos, physiological measurements can give more detailed information about the perception of multimedia consumers. Thus, they provide better information about long-term effects as they are difficult to estimate by purely subjective studies. The current study uses electroencephalography (EEG) to measure effects of fatigue during watching low and high quality videos. Therefore, a usual video was chosen, after partly reducing the bit rate of the video subjects watched it and gave subjective ratings accompanied by measuring EEG. With the obtained data we showed that lower video quality produces a higher percentage of alpha waves in the EEG, thus participants got more fatigued. Since these alpha waves are an indicator for the level of fatigue.	Arndt, S., Schleicher, R. & Antons, J.-N. 	Arndt, S., Schleicher, R. & Antons, J.-N. (2013, September).

2013-09-13	Subjective quality ratings and physiological correlates of synthesized speech	conferences	5th Int. Workshop on Quality of Multimedia Experience (QoMEX 2013)	Evaluating the quality of text-to-speech systems (TTS) is usually achieved by subjective methods where participants have to rate the stimulus on multiple scales, such as naturalness, prosody, and overall quality. In the present study, we aim towards evaluating TTS system quality using not only conventional subjective methods, but also via a neurophysiological approach based on obtaining neural correlates of TTS quality perception using electroencephalography (EEG). Such an approach allows for better insight into the perception processes involved during the human quality judgement process, and may open doors to innovative subjective testing methods and/or objective measurement tools. In our experiments, we have shown an inverse relationship between TTS speech quality and the amplitude of an EEG evoked response called the ‘P300,’ suggesting an increase in cognitive load as TTS quality decreases, likely due to reduction in speech intelligibility.

2013-09-19	Changes of vigilance caused by varying bit rate conditions	conferences	 5th Int. Workshop on Quality of Multimedia Experience (QoMEX 2013)	Quality aspects of media content are usually assessed by using subjective rating methods where subjects provide active feedback towards the perceived quality. The process how this judgment is being formed and the long-term influences of accompanying physiological processes are not represented by these methods. In this paper we used the electroencephalogram (EEG) to assess the cognitive state (vigilance) of listeners measured by the alpha frequency band power with respect to varying bit rate conditions. We show that stimuli with varying and constant bit rate cause a state of reduced vigilance. In addition we show the potential tendency that an interval of high bit rate audio inserted into a low bit rate stimulus increased the vigilance of listeners at the timescale of minutes. The results show that the perception of degraded media has long-term influences on physiological processes at the time scale of minutes which may influence customer behavior even though it probably stays undetected using purely standard subjective test methods.

2013-05-31	Cognitive, affective, and experience correlates of speech quality perception in complex listening conditions	conferences	IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing	Subjective speech quality assessment depends on listener “quality” opinions after hearing a particular test speech stimulus. Subjective scores are given based on a perception and quality judgment process that is unique to a particular listener. These processes are postulated to be dependent on the listener's internal reference of what good and bad quality sounds like, as well as their mental and emotional states. To overcome this variability, subjective listening tests often average scores over several listeners. In this paper, we use electroencephalography (EEG) and self-assessment tools to investigate the neural and affective correlates of speech quality perception of reverberant speech, with the goal of obtaining new insights into human speech quality perception in complex listening environments. We show that EEG event related potentials (ERP) are a useful tool to monitor the conscious stages of neural-processing during a speech quality assessment task. Significant correlations were obtained between the so-called P300 ERP component and the reverberation time of the room, as well as between the P300 peak amplitude and emotional self-assessment ratings. These insights could lead to more effective ways of characterizing room acoustics for improved speech quality and intelligibility.

This paper focuses on how different feedback modalities are perceived by users introducing a test method that is new in this field of research. The evaluation is done via standard self-assessment and by analyzing brain activity [electroencephalogram (EEG)]. We conducted an experiment with unimodal and multi-modal feedback combinations, and compared behavioral user data to EEG data. We could show that EEG is a feasible method for quantifying conscious processing of feedback in different modalities as it correlates highly with subjective ratings. EEG can thus be considered an additional tool for assessing the effectiveness of feedback, revealing conscious and potential non-conscious information processing.

2012-08-09	Perception of low-quality videos analyzed by means of electroencephalography	conferences	4th Int. Workshop on Quality of Multimedia Experience (QoMEX 2012)	The subjective evaluation of video quality mostly relies on opinion tests in which test participants judge perceived quality on rating scales. However, these methods provide limited insight how the quality judgments are being formed in the brain. In past studies we showed the general feasibility to complement opinion tests with physiological measures, as the electroencephalography (EEG), for pure video and audio experiments. To establish EEG as a reliable complement measurement method in standard quality rating tests, the next step is to validate the method in the audiovisual domain. For this purpose we conducted an experiment using audiovisual stimuli and degraded these in both modalities. We show that the more degraded a video is the earlier and higher the P300 amplitude is rising. In addition, the peak amplitudes are highly correlated with the audiovisual Mean Opinion Score (MOS).

2012-08-09	Too tired for calling? A physiological measure of fatigue caused by bandwidth limitations	conferences	4th Int. Workshop on Quality of Multimedia Experience (QoMEX 2012)	Common methods to determine the quality of media rely on conscious ratings of a subject's opinion about the quality of presented stimuli. While such methods provide a reliable and valid means of determining quality, they provide little insight into the physiological processes preceding the quality judgment, which, however, may affect the subjective behavior, e.g., in terms of alertness or media usage duration. In this paper we used a non-intrusive physiological method, electroencephalography, to assess the cognitive state of subjects related to the quality of auditory speech stimuli. We show that users listening to degraded audio rated the quality lower in comparison to an undisturbed stimulus as expected and, in addition, got more fatigued during the 20 minute presentation. Indicators of the increased fatigue were Theta and Alpha frequencies of the electroencephalogram data. The results show that the perception of degraded media has long-term influences on physiological processes at the time scale of minutes which may immediately influence customer behavior.

2012-01-09	A Physiological Approach to Determine Video Quality	conferences	IEEE International Symposium on Multimedia (ISM 2011)	Video quality has turned out to be a crucial aspect of multimodal transmission services. Most common video quality tests rely on a conscious judgment of test participants reflecting their internal quality perception. But it is not completely clear how this conscious rating is formed, neither in the auditory nor in the visual domain. Initial audio tests with Electroencephalography (EEG) have shown that EEG recordings can be used as a sensitive and non-intrusive method for quality assessment. In this paper we conducted first experiments of pure video quality tests with EEG to complement this approach in the visual domain. One of the goals for this experiment was to show that there is a different pattern in the EEG data for cases with no distortion compared to cases when there was a distortion and the subject recognized this in the subjective test.

2010-09-08	Neural correlates of speech degradation – Subjective ratings and brain activation in case of signal-correlated noise	conferences	3rd International Workshop on Perceptual Quality of Systems (PQS 2010)	Recent studies with magnetoencephalography (MEG) have shown that the human auditory cortex is particularly sensitive to reduction in sound and speech quality. In this paper, we examine whether this sensitivity is also visible in the electroencephalogram (EEG) and whether it is possible to detect subconscious processes which can then be used to improve the behavioral assessment of speech quality. In order to compare the physiological results with behavioral measurements, we degraded a speech stimulus (vowel /a/) in a scalable way and asked for a pair comparison (PC) and a comparison category rating (CCR) of the degraded stimuli. In addition, the brain activity of eleven healthy subjects was measured with EEG, focusing on event-related potentials (ERPs). We found that the threshold as set by the Modulated Noise Reference Unit (MNRU) for the PC and CCR are on a similar signal-to-noise level. We trained classifiers, which were found capable of distinguishing between events which are seemingly similar at the behavioral level (i.e., no button press). Converging evidence suggests that the classifier results could reflect subconscious cortical sensitivity to sound degradations.	Antons, J.-N., Schleicher, R., Wolf, I., Porbadnigk, A.

2010-11-11	Using ERPs for assessing the (sub) conscious perception of noise	conferences	32nd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC 2010)	In this paper, we investigate the use of event-related potentials (ERPs) as a quantitative measure for quality assessment of disturbed audio signals. For this purpose, we ran an EEG study (N=11) using an oddball paradigm, during which subjects were presented with the phoneme /a/, superimposed with varying degrees of signal-correlated noise. Based on this data set, we address the question to which degree the degradation of the auditory stimuli is reflected on a neural level, even if the disturbance is below the threshold of conscious perception. For those stimuli that are consciously recognized as being disturbed, we suggest the use of the amplitude and latency of the P300 component for assessing the level of disturbance. For disturbed stimuli for which the noise is not perceived consciously, we show for two subjects that a classifier based on shrinkage LDA can be applied successfully to single out stimuli, for which the noise was presumably processed subconsciously.

Content for extended reality is an aesthetic experience combining a series of multifaceted media, which combined offers a unique experience to its users. Unlike traditional media, extended reality content allows users to interact and observe this content using a large variety of methods. Such interactivity leads to a series of opportunities and even questions as to how these virtual worlds are perceived, interacted with or how they influence the player themselves, both from a physiological and emotional perspective. This Research Topic tasked authors to submit their work exploring this especially daunting task, inviting multi-faceted research including Research Topic such as affective computing, procedural content generation, game content orchestration, human computer interaction and human physiological reaction to the content. One of the main difficulties when dealing with interactive content is the collection of data, classifying this data into an emotional recognition task and subsequently using this recognition to alter the game in some meaningful capacity. The first and second tasks can be a difficult due to the nature of extended reality media devices themselves, which are often active endeavours complicating the collection of physiological data, it can also decrease the effectiveness of traditional facial recognition methods due to the hardware that is being used (e.g., Head Mounted Devices, or HMD), and the heavy reliance on user annotations which itself can often be highly relative and conflicting among the population. Thus, this Research Topic focused on several aspects of the latter Research Topic, by exploring the current technological trend in HMD technologies - i.e., eye-tracking devices and integrated EEG/EMG; and how this data could be used to model human affect.

However, the extent of an individuals´ mobility relies largely on their personal, social, and environmental resources as outlined in the Life-Space Constriction Model. Recent studies mainly focus on facilitating habitual out-of-home mobility by fostering one type of resources only. The MOBILE trial aims at testing whether tablet-assisted motivational counselling enhances the mobility of community-dwelling older adults by addressing personal, social, and environmental resources.

2020-11-24	QUALINET White Paper on Definitions of Immersive Media Experience (IMEx)	manuscripts	arXiv preprint 	With the coming of age of virtual/augmented reality and interactive media, numerous definitions, frameworks, and models of immersion have emerged across different fields ranging from computer graphics to literary works. Immersion is oftentimes used interchangeably with presence as both concepts are closely related. However, there are noticeable interdisciplinary differences regarding definitions, scope, and constituents that are required to be addressed so that a coherent understanding of the concepts can be achieved. Such consensus is vital for paving the directionality of the future of immersive media experiences (IMEx) and all related matters. The aim of this white paper is to provide a survey of definitions of immersion and presence which leads to a definition of immersive media experience (IMEx). The Quality of Experience (QoE) for immersive media is described by establishing a relationship between the concepts of QoE and IMEx followed by application areas of immersive media experience. Influencing factors on immersive media experience are elaborated as well as the assessment of immersive media experience. Finally, standardization activities related to IMEx are highlighted and the white paper is concluded with an outlook related to future developments.	Perkis, A., Timmerer, C., Baraković, S., Husić, J.

2024-06-01	Dishonesty Tendencies in Testing Scenarios Among Students with Virtual Reality and Computer-Mediated Technology	conferences	International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction	Virtual reality (VR) systems have the potential to be an innovation in the field of e-learning. Starting with fully functional e-classes, VR technologies can be used to build entire e-campuses. The power of VR is that it allows for stronger contact with students than computer-mediated technology. Deceptive behaviour, both verbal and nonverbal, refers to intentional activities designed to deceive others. Students often engage in dishonest practices to make progress. Whether it is cheating on an exam, copying another student’s essay, or inflating their GPA, the motivation for cheating is rarely simply a lack of preparation. Even though some may see academic dishonesty as an asset, the reality is that it can have major consequences. This poster demonstrates the findings from a study of students’ deceitful behaviour during a test in VR and in real-life situations. For this user study, 22 volunteers were invited to test, with each experiment involving exactly two participants and the examiner present in the room. Students were invited to take two tests: one in VR and one on a laptop. Their goal was to score as many points as possible by simulating a real-world online exam. Participants were requested to complete questionnaires during and after each experiment, which assisted in collecting additional data for this study. The results indicate that the amount of cheating that happened in VR and on a laptop was exactly the same.	Kojić, T., Vergari, M., Dovhalevska, A., Möller, S. & Voigt-Antons, J.-N.

2024-06-01	Optimizing XR User Experiences Through Network-Based Asset Bundles	conferences	International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction	Even though XR apps are becoming more widely used, one common issue is the need for more processing power on hardware to handle the complexity of the objects that need to be rendered. This study tests a system that shifts the computational load to the network and transfers information from a server to an XR device to maximize different aspects of user experience (e.g., innovativeness, consistency and control). The technical implementation utilizes the Unity 3D Engine to create and construct a Virtual Reality (VR) environment that embeds a communication mechanism between the server and the XR device. It uses distributed assets kept on a server as Asset Bundles. Asset Bundles provide a technique that enables dynamic loading at runtime. This allows for the minimization of local processing demands. The chosen application exemplifies this methodology in a “Pirate Game”, where players incrementally render ships. The “Surge.hs” was selected as the remote server in this process due to its seamless integration with the Unity editor, facilitating the storage and retrieval of 3D models. The study’s core contribution lies in testing the proposed solution and reporting loading times for 3D models from the network. Empirical results show the solution’s effectiveness, revealing initial loading times of approximately 800ms, followed by subsequent loading times experiencing a notable 60 to 80% reduction. This demonstrates the practicality of the suggested technique by giving an interesting method for displaying 3D models from a network, hence increasing the XR user experience.

2024-06-01	The Influence of the Level of Detail and Interactivity of 3D Elements on UX in XR Applications	conferences	International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction (HCII 2024)	In the realm of extended reality (XR) applications, a significant challenge lies in the resource-intensive rendering of 3D models, which often demand high computational power, creating a need for optimization. However, not all elements within a 3D environment are equally important for the user experience (UX). Recognizing and effectively addressing this could greatly enhance the performance of XR applications. How can manipulating the level of detail (LOD) increase the overall quality of user interactions? It was hypothesised that there would be no significant effect on participants’ perception of the reduction of LOD for non-interactive objects, thereby forming the null hypothesis for H1. Additionally, a second hypothesis was proposed: The reduction of LOD of non-interactive objects would not significantly affect the game enjoyment, forming the null hypothesis for H2 .  A virtual reality (VR) survival game was developed in Unreal Engine to test these hypotheses. The virtual environment contained two types of objects: interactive objects (e.g., barrels and weapons) and non-interactive objects (e.g., pallets and shelves). Using interactive objects, players must defend themselves against multiple enemies. Users had to play through different conditions with a decreasing LOD of non-interactive objects and answer a post-session questionnaire. Only 5 out of 53 participants noticed a difference in quality. Furthermore, the majority of participants reported equal game satisfaction for every condition. These findings indicate that a decrease in the LOD of non-interactive objects is not significantly perceptible and does not significantly affect the UX.

2024-06-01	Effect of External Characteristics of a Virtual Human Being During the Use of a Computer-Assisted Therapy Tool	conferences	International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction (HCII 2024)	The relevance of identification within media and its capacity to impact the user effectively has been a research focal point for years whether it is a real or fictional character. Identification in the media context shapes behavior and broadens the user’s social and emotional experience. In immersive media (such as video games), virtual entities, e.g., virtual agents, avatars, or Non-Player Characters (NPCs), bridge the gap between users and the virtual realm. The sense of immersion is usually accompanied by a higher degree of identification. When using visual representations, i.e., in the form of an avatar or agent, new challenges arise concerning the visual design. In this context, media effects, especially identification, can again make the interaction more pleasant and attractive. While in many contexts of use, decisions can be made regarding visualization using the target group, research in recent years points to the potential of user-defined design, so-called customization. Although it seems obvious here that users visualize a virtual image of themselves in such cases, there are also other approaches to using customization. An essential question in this context is whether and to what extent the identification with a virtual avatar could influence the user experience of a psychological intervention. In this work, we explore the effect of visual similarity of a virtual anthropomorphic agent on the user experience in an intervention to reduce the effect of dysfunctional beliefs. In an experiment, 22 participants were asked to create a virtual agent in two groups, similar and dissimilar to them, and then, the avatar confronted them with their dysfunctional thoughts. The results show that the similarity of the virtual agent is not only associated with statistically significant increased identification but also with a positive influence on emotions and intrinsic motivation (more interest and enjoyment). This work contributes to the exploration of customization and identification, especially with virtual agents, and the potential implications for their visual design in the context of computer-assisted therapy tools.

2024-03-15	Designing User Centered Simulations of Leadership Situations for Cave Automatic Virtual Environments: Development and Usability Study	conferences	International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction (HCII 2023)	Given that experience is a pivotal dimension of learning processes in the field of leadership, the ongoing and unresolved issue is how such experiential moments could be provided when developing leadership skills and competencies. Role-plays and business simulations are widely used in this context as they are said to teach relevant social leadership skills, like those required by everyday communication to followers, by decision-making on compensation, evaluating performance, dealing with conflicts, or terminating contracts. However, the effectiveness of simulations can highly vary depending on the counterpart's ability to act in the given scenarios. In our project, we deal with how immersive media could create experiential learning based on simulations for leadership development. In recent years different variations of extended reality got significant technological improvements. Head-mounted displays are an easy and cost-efficient way to present high-resolution virtual environments. For groups of people that are part of an immersive experience, cave automatic virtual environments offer an excellent trade-off between actual exchange with other humans and interaction with virtual content simultaneously. The work presented is based on developing a user-centered simulation of leadership situations for cave automatic virtual environments and includes the results of a first usability study. In the future, the presented results can help to support the development and evaluation of simulated situations for cave automatic virtual environments with an emphasis on leadership-related scenarios.

For that, the first important aspects of AR will be introduced, defined, and at times complemented and compared with known concepts from Virtual Reality.After assessing the current state-of-the-art by investigating related literature, the motivation behind an integrated approach will be explained in more detail and the implementation of the SAM prototype with the UI design platform Figma will be introduced. Results from the conducted user study will provide valuable insight into how the three-dimensional SAM was received and consider the opportunities and limitations of the implemented design.

2024-04-25	Impact of spatial auditory navigation on user experience during augmented outdoor navigation tasks	conferences	Annual congress of the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Akustik	The auditory sense of humans is important when it comes to navigation. The importance is especially high in cases when an object of interest is visually partly or fully covered. Interactions with users of technology are mainly focused on the visual domain of navigation tasks. This paper presents the results of a literature review and user study exploring the impact of spatial auditory navigation on user experience during an augmented outdoor navigation task. For the user test, participants used an augmented reality app guiding them to different locations with different digital augmentation. We conclude that the utilization of the auditory sense is yet still underrepresented in augmented reality applications. In the future, more usage scenarios for audio-augmented reality such as navigation will enhance user experience and interaction quality.

General practitioners (GPs) play a key role in the care of people with dementia (PwD). However, the potentials of evidence-based dementia guidelines in primary care remain unclear. The main objective of the present study was to examine the role of guideline-based dementia care in general practices and to evaluate the effectiveness of a tablet-based intervention aiming at improving guideline-based care. A two arm, cluster-randomized controlled trial (cRCT) with an intervention group (tablet-based intervention) and a control group (treatment as usual) was conducted from April 15, 2018, to July 31, 2021, in Berlin and the surrounding area. Primary outcome was defined as adherence to dementia guideline recommendations after 9 months. Secondary outcomes included various health outcomes assessed in PwD (e.g., quality of life). Linear Mixed Models were used to analyse cross sectional baseline data. Primary and secondary outcomes were analysed by intention-to-treat analysis and using Mixed Models. Data of N = 28 GPs and N = 91 PwD was analysed. PwD were on average 80.5 years old (SD = 6.3), 59% were female. Self-reported overall guideline adherence of GPs was on average 71% (SD = 19.4, range: 25–100). Further, lower guideline adherence was found to be significantly associated with higher numbers of patients (γ10 = − 5.58, CI = − 10.97, − 0.19, p = .04). The effectiveness of the cRCT is still under evaluation. Final results will be presented and discussed at the GSA Annual Scientific Meeting. Further, implications and conclusions of the trial will be provided.	Lech, S., O´Sullivan, J. L., Spang, R. P., Voigt-Antons, J.-N., Gellert, P. & Nordheim, J.	Lech, S., O´Sullivan, J. L., Spang, R.

This requires preprocessing the raw data obtained from GPS sensors, like clustering significant locations and distinguishing these from periods on the go. We introduce a new stop and trip detection algorithm to transform a list of position records into intervals of dwelling and transit. The system is based on geometrical analyses of the signal noise: Imperfect GPS data tends to scatter around an actual dwell position in a star-like pattern, and this imperfection is what we leverage for our classification. The system contains four independent classification methods, comparing different aspects of the geometrical properties of a given trajectory. If available, accelerometer readings can be used to improve the system’s accuracy further. To evaluate the classifier’s performance, we recorded a large dataset containing gold-standard labels and compared the classification results of our system with the results of Scikit Mobility and Moving Pandas. Our Stop Go Classifier outperforms the traditional distance/time-threshold-based systems. The described system is available as free software.	Spang, R.

2022-08-06	The STAGA-Dataset: Stop and Trip Annotated GPS and Accelerometer Data of Everyday Life	conferences 	Free and Open Source Software for Geospatial	 Identifying stops and trips from raw GPS traces is a fundamental preprocessing step for most mobility research applications. Thus, ensuring the excellent accuracy of such systems is of high interest to researchers designing such analysis pipelines. While there are plenty of GPS datasets available, these usually do not provide annotations and thus cannot be used for benchmarking stop/trip classifiers easily. This manuscript introduces a GPS & accelerometer dataset, including accurate stop/trip annotations. It contains 122,808 GPS samples as one continuous trajectory, spanning over 126 days. The recorded time frame includes working days, vacations, travelling, everyday life and all regular modes of transportation. During recording, a detailed mobility diary was conducted to capture each dwelling period’s exact beginning and end. The position and diary data combined contain 78,900 labelled stops and 43,908 labelled trips. This serves as ground truth for stop/trip classification algorithms to test existing tools or develop new analysis methods.

2022-11-24	ColorTable: Manipulating Tasting Experiences, Impact of Light Color on Food Flavor Perception	conferences	International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction	Multi-sensory perception of taste and flavour is one of the more complex perceptional experiences. The taste itself in food can be perceived differently by its presentation and therefore, flavor perception can be manipulated. ColorTable is a dining table with a lighting system based on Philips Hue Wireless Lighting System. The table can illuminate dishes with thousands of various colors. In this paper, we examine if different light colors of ColorTable influence the perception of taste and the visual appearance of food. We show that food experience and taste perception is changed by different colors emitted by ColorTable. As food items, we choose sweet and salted popcorn and more complex flavored industrial produced Black Forest Cake. Based on a qualitative pretest with participants, we selected the light colors for the food items. Participants selected the best and worse matching light colors for both items to be used. As a result, the cake was illuminated in the experiment with pink and orange light color and sweet and salty popcorn with white and blue light color in a neutral light lab environment. The overall flavor of the cake was significantly higher with pink light color than with orange light color. A similar result was persistent for sweet popcorn, which was rated better when consumed with blue light color than with white light color. We conclude that the perceived taste and visual appeal of food can be altered with ColorTable. Objectively same quality food can be served tastier and improve the food experience, not only through the taste and smell of food itself but also by its presentation and representation. This approach can enhance the tasting experience and on the long run probably also enable a better understanding sense of smell and taste for food experiences.

2022-06-16	Reconstruction and Physiological Basis of Samsung’s Galaxy Watch Stress Score	conferences	International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction. Virtual event. 	The detection and avoidance of negative stress are worthwhile endeavors from economic, individual, and public health perspectives. At the same time, the proliferation of wearables promises monitoring of physiological characteristics continuously and at a low cost. However, existing stress tracking solutions use proprietary methodology when operationalizing physiological measurements into abstract stress measures and remain vague on the implementation details.We investigated the stress measuring capabilities of the Samsung Galaxy Watch Active2 smartwatch, as it was one of the first wearables to be advertised for its stress score functionality. Forty-five participants were exposed to cognitive load under time pressure in a randomized controlled trial. The smartwatch recorded stress scores during the experiment, and an ECG was used to monitor cardiac activity. The latter allowed us to record individual stress reactions through different heart rate variability measures (HRV). Subjective perception of the workload was reported using the NASA Task Load Index questionnaire. The smartwatch primarily relies on heart rate (bpm) to derive its stress metrics. We were able to reconstruct Samsung’s stress score closely; a random forest regressor based on five features models the smartwatch’s stress score with a significant coefficient of determination. However, the physiological responses indicate a sub-optimal induction of cognitive workload through the chosen mental arithmetic task. Smartphone manufacturers are eager to advertise stress monitoring features but often fail to define what exactly these are doing. Moreover, while the literature provides a body of evidence for measuring short-term mental stress through HRV metrics, the smartwatch we investigated primarily relies on plain heart rate readings to determine the mental state of its users. This could indicate a lack of scientific backing and should be considered when choosing a valid and reliable tool for stress monitoring	Spang, R.

2022-05-29	Towards Improvement of UX Using Gamification for Public Artistic and Historical Artifacts in AR	conferences	International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction. Virtual event	Recently, Augmented Reality (AR) applications have emerged as a powerful tool to empower users in touristic use cases, for example, by recreating digital representations of lost or difficult accessible artifacts. More emphasis has been put on researching possible solutions for tourism with AR technology. As part of such a research project, an AR touristic experience was designed to enhance historical artifacts, promote surroundings exploration, and study how to improve the User Experience (UX). This resulted in developing an engaging and interactive cross-platform AR mobile application. The final application includes multiple gamified reward systems, such as collecting points for each artistic/historical spot visited. Users’ available time while visiting or exploring was also considered in the design of the experience, so the option to choose between complete and short routes was offered. Following the intended route was supported by instructing the users to collect a sequence of AR coins placed based on GPS functionalities. Despite some limitations, especially given by the GPS feature used to support route navigation, the analysis showed that the developed AR application was evaluated as very good in terms of usability score. This technical limitation was more evident in users that played the experience with old-generation smartphones. The assessment of the developed application has concluded that the attention paid to features, content, and duration of the activity has a positive impact, succeeding both in terms of product results and users’ satisfaction.

2022-06-16	Assessing User Experience of Text Readability with Eye Tracking in Virtual Reality	conferences	International conference on Human-Computer Interaction	Virtual Reality (VR) technology is mostly used in gaming, videos, engineering applications, and training simulators. One thing which is shared among all of them is the necessity to display text. Text reading experience is not always in focus for VR systems because of limited hardware capabilities, lack of standardization, user interface (UI) design flaws, and physical design of Head-Mounted Displays (HMDs). With this paper, key variables from the UI design side were researched that can improve text reading user experience in VR. Therefore four important points for reading in VR application were selected to be focused on: 1) Difference in canvas type (flat/curved), 2) Contrast on virtual scene (light/dark), 3) Number of columns in layout (1 column/2 column/3 column) 4) Text distance from the subject (1.5 m/6.5 m). For a user study a VR app for Oculus Quest was developed, enabling the possibility to display text while varying some of the features important for readability in VR. This user experiment has shown parameters that are important for text reading experience in VR. Specifically, subjects performed very well when the text was on a 6.5-meter distance from the subject with font size 22pt, on a flat canvas with one column layout. When it comes to physiological variables, the conditions measurements were behaving similarly, as all of the selected parameters were in line with the design guidelines. Therefore, selection on final settings should be more oriented towards user experience and preferences.	Kojić, T., Vergari, M., Möller, S. & Voigt-Antons, J.-N.

Deutschen Kongress für Versorgungsforschung 	Hintergrund/Fragestellung/Problem: Außerhäusliche Mobilität ist ein wichtiger Faktor für ein gesundes Älterwerden, soziale Partizipation und Nutzung gesundheitlicher Versorgungsstrukturen. Aktuelle Studien aus der Alternsforschung beschäftigen sich mit der Erfassung und Auswertung GPS-basierter Bewegungsdaten, um den Zusammenhang des außerhäuslichen Bewegungsverhaltens mit physischer und mentaler Gesundheit zu analysieren. Hierbei wir oft ein Querschnittsdesign verwendet. Wie kann eine Evaluation einer Hausbesuchsintervention zur Förderung außerhäuslicher Mobilität alter Menschen im ländlichen Raum unter Einbeziehung neuer konsolidierter Standards zur Erfassung GPS-basierter Bewegungsdaten im Längsschnitt-Design ausgeführt werden? Lösungen und Lösungsvorschläge: Den Teilnehmer:innen der MOBILE-Studie wird ein Smartphone mit einer von der TU Berlin entwickelten App zur Erfassung GPS-basierter Bewegungsdaten ausgehändigt. Dieses erhebt außerhäusliche Bewegungsdaten für jeweils sieben Tage zur Baseline (T0) nach 4 Wochen (T1) und nach 3 Monaten (T3). Nach wissenschaftlichen konsolidierten Standards entwickelte Algorithmen bestimmen Kerncharakteristiken der außerhäuslichen Mobilität. Dies sind z.B. Lebensraummaße (Convex-Hull) oder andere Raum-Zeitparameter (z.B. Minuten außerhalb der Wohnung pro Tag) an deren Veränderung zwischen den Messzeitpunkten der Einfluss der Hausbesuchsintervention evaluiert wird. Schlussfolgerung/Diskussion/Lessons Learned: Die vorgeschlagene Lösung wird bezüglich ihrer Gebrauchstauglichkeit als auch der technischeren Präzision evaluiert. Dabei wird ein besonderes Augenmerk auf die privatsphärengerechte Umsetzung der Aufzeichnung von Bewegungsdaten gelegt. Hemmnisse bei der Nutzung neuer Technologien alter Menschen müssen vor und während der Datenerhebung berücksichtigt und mit transparenten und leicht verständlichen Erklärungen versehen werden. Weitere Nutzungsmöglichkeiten der GPS-Technologie in der Versorgungsforschung (z.B. adäquate Behandlungsplanung, Zieldefinition und Evaluation) sind zu diskutieren.	Mümken, S., Spang, R.

2021-07-03	Influence of Visualisation Design of Data Streams on User Experience in Virtual Reality	conferences	International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction	The continuous growth in technology has brought some revolutionary changes in various domains, resulting in considerable data accumulation. Although traditional segregation and displaying data might still be possible, it may be difficult for users to extract the quintessence from them. Data is one of the most practical terms, irrespective of its origin or time, and it does have an interesting story to convey. There is a need for the data to be presented more innovatively, so that obscure and complex data can be comprehended easily. Still, it all may come down to good storytelling in many cases and enabling people to connect with the data. With this research study, we leverage virtual reality concepts to compare two techniques to visualise data - traditionally numerical and creative. The aim is to bring data into virtual reality to help one interact and visualise data in a three-dimensional environment, thereby adding more fun and compelling ways to analyse and evaluate. With this research, we would like to devise various design paradigms that could be used to display or represent data in a virtual environment. Having two different virtual environments representing the office and nature, users (N = 19) of the user study had to evaluate if they could recognise the connection between numerical and creative visualisation. Interestingly, users have reported a higher arousal intensity (measure by SAM questionnaire) when the environment and the expected visualisation are not matching. Further on, results suggest that the different kind of visualisation can be more effective and can be used for future VR applications.

2021-07-03	Automatic Recognition of Experienced Emotional State from Body Movement	conferences	International Conference on Human Computer Interaction	Although body movement carries information about a person’s emotional state, this modality is not widely used in automatic emotion measurement systems. With this paper, we address the question of the automatic recognition of a person’s affective state by analyzing the way a person moves. We present the approach which was used to build a classifier of experienced, non-acted emotions. To collect the data to train and validate the classifier, a controlled laboratory study was conducted. During the study, the music mood induction procedure was used to evoke different emotions in the participants. The participant’s movement was recorded using a depth sensor, two accelerometers, and two electromyography sensors. An accuracy of 43% was achieved to recognize four emotion classes, corresponding to four quadrants of the valence-arousal space. For the participants with lower dance or movement proficiency, recognition was more accurate. The same was discovered for the participants with higher comfort levels of moving in front of a camera. The findings show the potential for the automatic analysis of a person’s body movements to gather information about an affective state.	Voigt-Antons, J.-N., Devaikin, P. & Kojić, T.

2021-07-03	DemSelf, A Mobile App for Self-administered Touch-Based Cognitive Screening: Participatory Design with Stakeholders	conferences	International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction	Early detection of mild cognitive impairment and dementia is vital as many therapeutic interventions are particularly effective at an early stage. A self-administered touch-based cognitive screening instrument, called DemSelf, was developed by adapting an examiner-administered paper-based instrument, the Quick Mild Cognitive Impairment (Qmci) screen. We conducted five semi-structured expert interviews including a think-aloud phase to evaluate usability problems. The extent to which the characteristics of the original subtests change by the adaption, as well as the conditions and appropriate context for practical application, were also in question. The participants had expertise in the domain of usability and human-machine interaction and/or in the domain of dementia and neuropsychological assessment. Participants identified usability issues in all components of the DemSelf prototype. For example, confirmation of answers was not consistent across subtests. Answers were sometimes logged directly when a button is tapped and cannot be corrected. This can lead to frustration and bias in test results, especially for people with vision or motor impairments. The direct adoption of time limits from the original paper-based instrument or the simultaneous verbal and textual item presentation also caused usability problems. DemSelf is a different test than Qmci and needs to be re-validated. Visual recognition instead of a free verbal recall is one of the main differences. Reading skill level seems to be an important confounding variable. Participants would generally prefer if the test is conducted in a medical office rather than at a patient’s home so that someone is present for support and the result can be discussed directly	Burghart, M., O´Sullivan, J.

2021-07-03	User Experience of Connected Services in Cars	conferences	International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction	Connected Services are innovative, mostly web-based features of state-of-the-art cars that offer the user a broad range of entertainment, communication, or navigation functionalities. The trend towards connectivity and the accompanying customer expectations can be seen as one of the driving forces for the automotive industry’s rapid transformation. Car manufacturers can achieve a competitive advantage only through an extensive service portfolio coupled with great user experience, which is expressed through the fulfillment of underlying customer needs. In this paper, a scoring model for evaluating the user experience of Connected Services based on need structures was designed and tested on ten different cars. A general impression of the user experience can be drawn by focusing on need structures. In the future, this can be translated into product requirements which may lead to more satisfied customers.

2020-07-10	Predicting Tap Locations on Touch Screens in the Field Using Accelerometer and Gyroscope Sensor Readings	conferences	International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction	Research has shown that the location of touch screen taps on modern smartphones and tablet computers can be identified based on sensor recordings from the device’s accelerometer and gyroscope. This security threat implies that an attacker could launch a background process on the mobile device and send the motion sensor readings to a third party vendor for further analysis. Even though the location inference is a non-trivial task requiring machine learning algorithms in order to predict the tap location, previous research was able to show that PINs and passwords of users could be successfully obtained. However, as the tap location inference was only shown for taps generated in a controlled setting not reflecting the environment users naturally engage with their smartphones, the attempts in this paper bridge this gap. We propose TapSensing, a data acquisition system designed to collect touch screen tap event information with corresponding accelerometer and gyroscope readings. Having performed a data acquisition study with 27 participants and 3 different iPhone models, a total of 25,000 labeled taps could be acquired from a laboratory and field environment enabling a direct comparison of both settings. The overall findings show that tap location inference is generally possible for data acquired in the field, hence, with a performance reduction of approximately 20% when comparing both environments. As the tap inference has therefore been shown for a more realistic data set, this work shows that smartphone motion sensors could potentially be used to comprise the user’s privacy in any surrounding user’s interact with the devices.

2020-07-10	Accuracy Assessment of ARKit 2 Based Gaze Estimation	conferences	International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction	With the growing amount of mobile application usage, assuring a high quality of experience became more and more important. Besides traditional subjective methods to test and prototype new developments, eye tracking is a prominent tool to assess quality and UX of a software product. Although portable eye trackers exist, the technology is still mostly associated with expensive laboratory equipment. To change that and to run quick and cheap eye-tracking studies in the field, attempts have been made to turn everyday hardware like smartphone cameras and webcams into eye trackers. This study explores the possibility of using a standard library of iOS to tackle the vast technical complexity usually coming with such approaches. The accuracy of an eye-tracking system purely based on the ARKit APIs of iOS is evaluated in two user studies (N = 9 & N = 8). The results indicate that an ARKit based gaze tracker provides comparable performance in terms of accuracy (, or 1.44 cm on screen), while at the same time, it uses far fewer hardware resources and provides a higher sample-rate than any other smartphone eye tracker. Especially the easy to use API is the main advantage over the technical complex systems which rely on their own image analysis for gaze estimation. Privacy implications are discussed.

2016-04-26	Motivating New Interaction Experiences Involving Implicit Interaction, Body Sensors, Adaptive, and Persuasive Interfaces	conferences	Future and Emerging Trends in Language Technology	In most cases, speech and language technology is used for explicit interaction with computers. However, in a connected world the technology can also to be used for other purposes. It is the aim of this position statement to open research questions which point at the potential of speech and language technology for enabling new interaction experiences such as implicit interactions, body sensors, adaptive and persuasive interfaces. The research questions are grouped into three domains: user, system and context. In the user domain, our focus will be on information that can be extracted from the user. In the system domain, our focus in on crowdsourcing and privacy concerns. The focus point in the context domain is on implicit interactions and intelligent interactions.	Möller, S. & Antons, J.-N.

Although digital applications can offer support, dementia-friendly options remain limited. This study highlights the importance of incorporating diverse perspectives—including those of general practitioners and family caregivers—into the development of supportive healthcare applications. Using a qualitative approach with interviews and an expert workshop, the research applied Kuckartz’s content analysis method supported by MAXQDA. The findings emphasize the need for multidisciplinary collaboration and iterative, feedback-driven design to create effective digital tools for dementia care.	Supplieth, J., Lech, S., O’Sullivan, J.

2025-09-01	Dynamic and Responsible Digital Twins for Extended Reality	manuscripts	Scientific Reports	Digital twins are living digital surrogates of objects and processes from the world around us and serve many purposes in situations where a physical model cannot be used. Digital twins can be considered to still be in their nascent phase, be it in the variety of application domains or in the science of creating and manipulating them. The DIDYMOS-XR project uses digital twins to create large-scale (city-wide) and long-term eXtended Reality (XR) applications. In this paper, we propose three use cases—city planning, city maintenance, and city tourism—along with an industrial use case for manufacturing environments, demonstrated through evaluation sites in Germany and Spain. The paper introduces cutting-edge solutions in the creation, simulation, and manipulation of DTs, including advancements in 3D scene reconstruction, data enhancement, data compression, sensor fusion, localization, rendering, and scene understanding. Additionally, we address the ethical and privacy challenges of digital twin systems and propose strategies for mitigating these issues. This work offers a comprehensive framework for creating semantically rich, scalable, and interactive digital twins, providing valuable insights for diverse applications in urban planning, maintenance, tourism, and industrial optimization.
